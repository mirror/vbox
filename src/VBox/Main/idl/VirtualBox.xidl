<desc>
  Welcome to the <b>VirtualBox Main API documentation</b>. This documentation
  describes the so-called <i>VirtualBox Main API</i> which comprises all public
  COM interfaces and components provided by the VirtualBox server and by the
  VirtualBox client library.

  VirtualBox employs a client-server design, meaning that whenever any part of
  VirtualBox is running -- be it the Qt GUI, the VBoxManage command-line
  interface or any virtual machine --, a dedicated server process named
  VBoxSVC runs in the background. This allows multiple processes working with
  VirtualBox to cooperate without conflicts. These processes communicate to each
  other using inter-process communication facilities provided by the COM
  implementation of the host computer.

  On Windows platforms, the VirtualBox Main API uses Microsoft COM, a native COM
  implementation. On all other platforms, Mozilla XPCOM, an open-source COM
  implementation, is used.

  All the parts that a typical VirtualBox user interacts with (the Qt GUI,
  the VBoxManage command-line interface and the VBoxVRDP server) are technically
  front-ends to the Main API and only use the interfaces that are documented
  in this Main API documentation. This ensures that, with any given release
  version of VirtualBox, all capabilities of the product that could be useful
  to an external client program are always exposed by way of this API.

  The VirtualBox Main API (also called the <i>VirtualBox COM library</i>)
  contains two public component classes:
  <tt>%VirtualBox.VirtualBox</tt> and <tt>%VirtualBox.Session</tt>, which
  implement IVirtualBox and ISession interfaces respectively. These two classes
  are of supreme importance and will be needed in order for any front-end
  program to do anything useful. It is recommended to read the documentation of
  the mentioned interfaces first.

  The <tt>%VirtualBox.VirtualBox</tt> class is a singleton. This means that
  there can be only one object of this class on the local machine at any given
  time. This object is a parent of many other objects in the VirtualBox COM
  library and lives in the VBoxSVC process. In fact, when you create an instance
  of the <tt>VirtualBox.VirtualBox</tt>, the COM subsystem checks if the VBoxSVC
  process is already running, starts it if not, and returns you a reference to
  the <tt>VirtualBox</tt> object created in this process. When the last reference
  to this object is released, the VBoxSVC process ends (with a 5 second delay to
  protect from too frequent restarts).

  The <tt>%VirtualBox.Session</tt> class is a regular component. You can create
  as many <tt>Session</tt> objects as you need but all of them will live in a
  process which issues the object instantiation call. <tt>Session</tt> objects
  represent virtual machine sessions which are used to configure virtual
  machines and control their execution.

  // COM result codes for VirtualBox

  <descGroup id="VirtualBox_COM_result_codes" title="VirtualBox COM result codes">
    <desc>
      This section describes all VirtualBox-specific COM result codes that may
      be returned by methods of VirtualBox COM interfaces in addition to
      standard COM result codes.

      Note that along with the result code, every VirtualBox method returns
      extended error information through the IVirtualBoxErrorInfo interface on
      failure. This interface is a preferred way to present the error to the end
      user because it contains a human readable description of the error. Raw
      result codes, both standard and described in this section, are intended to
      be used by programs to analyze the reason of a failure and select an
      appropriate course of action without involving the end user (for example,
      retry the operation later or make a different call).

      The standard COM result codes that may originate from our methods include:

      <table>
      <tr><td>E_INVALIDARG</td>
      <td>
        Returned when the value of the method's argument is not within the range
        of valid values. This should not be confused with situations when the
        value is within the range but simply doesn't suit the current object
        state and there is a possibility that it will be accepted later (in such
        cases VirtualBox-specific codes are returned, for example,
        <link to="VBOX_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND"/>).
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>E_POINTER</td>
      <td>
        Returned if a memory pointer for the output argument is invalid (for
        example, <tt>NULL</tt>). Note that when pointers representing input
        arguments (such as strings) are invalid, E_INVALIDARG is returned.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>E_ACCESSDENIED</td>
      <td>
        Returned when the called object is not ready. Since the lifetime of a
        public COM object cannot be fully controlled by the implementation,
        VirtualBox maintains the readiness state for all objects it creates and
        returns this code in response to any method call on the object that was
        deactivated by VirtualBox and is not functioning any more.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>E_OUTOFMEMORY</td>
      <td>
        Returned when a memory allocation operation fails.
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>

      Virtual machine execution state.

      This enumeration represents possible values of the <link
      to="IMachine::state"/> attribute.

      Below is the basic virtual machine state diagram. It shows how the state
      changes during virtual machine execution. The text in square braces shows
      a method of the IConsole interface that performs the given state
      transition.

      <pre>
            +---------[powerDown()] &lt;- Stuck &lt;--[failure]-+
            V                                             |
    +-&gt; PoweredOff --+--&gt;[powerUp()]--&gt; Starting --+      | +-----[resume()]-----+
    |                |                             |      | V                    |

    |   Saved -----------[powerUp()]--&gt; Restoring -+      | |                   | |
    |     ^                                               | |                   | |
    |     |     +-----------------------------------------+-|-------------------+ +
    |     |     |                                           |                     |
    |     |     +-- Saving &lt;--------[takeSnapshot()]&lt;-------+---------------------+
    |     |                                                 |                     |
    |     +-------- Saving &lt;--------[saveState()]&lt;----------+---------------------+
    |                                                       |                     |
    +-------------- Stopping -------[powerDown()]&lt;----------+---------------------+
      </pre>

      Note that states to the right from PoweredOff, Aborted and Saved in the
      above diagram are called <i>online VM states</i>. These states
      represent the virtual machine which is being executed in a dedicated
      process (usually with a GUI window attached to it where you can see the
      activity of the virtual machine and interact with it). There are two
      special pseudo-states, FirstOnline and LastOnline, that can be used in
      relational expressions to detect if the given machine state is online or
      not:

      <pre>
        if (machine.GetState() &gt;= MachineState_FirstOnline &amp;&amp;
            machine.GetState() &lt;= MachineState_LastOnline)
        {
            ...the machine is being executed...
        }
      </pre>

      When the virtual machine is in one of the online VM states (that is, being
      executed), only a few machine settings can be modified. Methods working
      with such settings contain an explicit note about that. An attempt to
      change any oter setting or perform a modifying operation during this time
      will result in the <link to="VBOX_E_INVALID_VM_STATE"/> error.

      All online states except Running, Paused and Stuck are transitional: they
      represent temporary conditions of the virtual machine that will last as
      long as the operation that initiated such a condition.

      The Stuck state is a special case. It means that execution of the machine
      has reached the "Guru Meditation" condition. This condition indicates an
      internal VMM (virtual machine manager) failure which may happen as a
      result of either an unhandled low-level virtual hardware exception or one
      of the recompiler exceptions (such as the <i>too-many-traps</i>
      condition).

      Note also that any online VM state may transit to the Aborted state. This
      happens if the process that is executing the virtual machine terminates
      unexpectedly (for example, crashes). Other than that, the Aborted state is
      equivalent to PoweredOff.

      There are also a few additional state diagrams that do not deal with
      virtual machine execution and therefore are shown separately. The states
      shown on these diagrams are called <i>offline VM states</i> (this includes
      PoweredOff, Aborted and Saved too).

      The first diagram shows what happens when a lengthy setup operation is
      being executed (such as <link to="IMachine::attachHardDisk"/>).

      <pre>
    +-----------------------------------(same sate as before the call)------+
    |                                                                       |
    +-&gt; PoweredOff --+                                                      |
    |                |                                                      |
    |-&gt; Aborted -----+--&gt;[lengthy VM configuration call] --&gt; SettingUp -----+
    |                |
    +-&gt; Saved -------+
      </pre>

      The next two diagrams demonstrate the process of taking a snapshot of a
      powered off virtual machine and performing one of the "discard..."
      operations, respectively.

      <pre>
    +-----------------------------------(same sate as before the call)------+
    |                                                                       |
    +-&gt; PoweredOff --+                                                      |
    |                +--&gt;[takeSnapshot()] -------------------&gt; Saving ------+

      Note that the Saving state is present in both the offline state group and
      online state group. Currently, the only way to determine what group is
      assumed in a particular case is to remember the previous machine state: if
      it was Running or Paused, then Saving is an online state, otherwise it is
      an offline state. This inconsistency may be removed in one of the future
      versions of VirtualBox by adding a new state.

      <note internal="yes">
        For whoever decides to touch this enum: In order to keep the
        comparisons involving FirstOnline and LastOnline pseudo-states valid,
        the numeric values of these states must be correspondingly updated if
        needed: for any online VM state, the condition
        <tt>FirstOnline &lt;= state &lt;= LastOnline</tt> must be
        <tt>true</tt>. The same relates to transient states for which
        the condition <tt>FirstOnline &lt;= state &lt;= LastOnline</tt> must be
        <tt>true</tt>.

  <interface
     name="IVirtualBoxErrorInfo" extends="$errorinfo"
     uuid="e98b5376-8eb4-4eea-812a-3964bf3bb26f"
     supportsErrorInfo="no"
     wsmap="suppress"
     >
    <desc>
      The IVirtualBoxErrorInfo interface represents extended error information.

      Extended error information can be set by VirtualBox components after
      unsuccessful or partially successful method invocation. This information
      can be retrieved by the calling party as an IVirtualBoxErrorInfo object
      and then shown to the client in addition to the plain 32-bit result code.

      In MS COM, this interface extends the IErrorInfo interface,
      in XPCOM, it extends the nsIException interface. In both cases,
      it provides a set of common attributes to retrieve error
      information.

      Sometimes invocation of some component's method may involve methods of
      other components that may also fail (independently of this method's
      failure), or a series of non-fatal errors may precede a fatal error that
      causes method failure. In cases like that, it may be desirable to preserve
      information about all errors happened during method invocation and deliver
      it to the caller. The <link to="#next"/> attribute is intended
      specifically for this purpose and allows to represent a chain of errors
      through a single IVirtualBoxErrorInfo object set after method invocation.

      Note that errors are stored to a chain in the reverse order, i.e. the
      initial error object you query right after method invocation is the last
      error set by the callee, the object it points to in the @a next attribute
      is the previous error and so on, up to the first error (which is the last
      in the chain).
    </desc>

    <attribute name="resultCode" type="result" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Result code of the error.
        Usually, it will be the same as the result code returned
        by the method that provided this error information, but not
        always. For example, on Win32, CoCreateInstance() will most
        likely return E_NOINTERFACE upon unsuccessful component
        instantiation attempt, but not the value the component factory
        returned.

      The IVirtualBox interface represents the main interface exposed by the
      product that provides virtual machine management.

      An instance of IVirtualBox is required for the product to do anything
      useful. Even though the interface does not expose this, internally,
      IVirtualBox is implemented as a singleton and actually lives in the
      process of the VirtualBox server (VBoxSVC.exe). This makes sure that
      IVirtualBox can track the state of all virtual machines on a particular
      host, regardless of which frontend started them.

      To enumerate all the virtual machines on the host, use the
      <link to="IVirtualBox::machines"/> attribute.

        as determined by the host OS), and cannot be changed.

    <attribute name="settingsFileVersion" type="wstring" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Current version of the format of the global VirtualBox settings file
        (<tt>VirtualBox.xml</tt>).

        The version string has the following format:
        <pre>
          x.y-platform
        </pre>
        where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are the major and the minor format
        versions, and <tt>platform</tt> is the platform identifier.

        The current version usually matches the value of the
        <link to="#settingsFormatVersion"/> attribute unless the
        settings file was created by an older version of VirtualBox and there
        was a change of the settings file format since then.

        Note that VirtualBox automatically converts settings files from older
        versions to the most recent version when reading them (usually at
        VirtualBox startup) but it doesn't save the changes back until
        you call a method that implicitly saves settings (such as
        <link to="#setExtraData"/>) or call <link to="#saveSettings"/>
        explicitly. Therefore, if the value of this attribute differs from the
        value of <link to="#settingsFormatVersion"/>, then it
        means that the settings file was converted but the result of the
        conversion is not yet saved to disk.

        The above feature may be used by interactive front-ends to inform users
        about the settings file format change and offer them to explicitly save
        all converted settings files (the global and VM-specific ones),
        optionally create backup copies of the old settings files before saving,
        etc.

    <attribute name="settingsFormatVersion" type="wstring" readonly="yes">

        Most recent version of the settings file format.

        The version string has the following format:
        <pre>
          x.y-platform
        </pre>
        where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are the major and the minor format
        versions, and <tt>platform</tt> is the platform identifier.

        VirtualBox uses this version of the format when saving settings files
        (either as a result of method calls that require to save settings or as
        a result of an explicit call to <link to="#saveSettings"/>).

    <method name="createMachine">
      <desc>
        Creates a new virtual machine.

        The new machine is created unregistered, with the initial configuration
        set according to the specified guest OS type. A typical sequence of
        actions to create a new virtual machine is as follows:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Call this method to have a new machine created. The returned machine
            object will be "mutable" allowing to change any machine property.
          </li>

          <li>
            Configure the machine using the appropriate attributes and methods.
          </li>

          <li>
            Call <link to="IMachine::saveSettings" /> to write the settings
            to the machine's XML settings file. The configuration of the newly
            created machine will not be saved to disk until this method is
            called.
          </li>

          <li>
            Call <link to="#registerMachine" /> to add the machine to the list
            of machines known to VirtualBox.
          </li>
        </ol>

        You should specify valid name for the newly created machine when calling
        this method. See the <link to="IMachine::name"/> attribute description
        for more details about the machine name.

        The specified guest OS type identifier must match an ID of one of known
        guest OS types listed in the <link to="IVirtualBox::guestOSTypes"/>
        array.

        Every machine has a <i>settings file</i> that is used to store
        the machine configuration. This file is stored in a directory called the
        <i>machine settings subfolder</i>. Both the settings subfolder and file
        will have a name that corresponds to the name of the virtual machine.
        You can specify where to create the machine setting subfolder using the
        @a baseFolder argument. The base folder can be absolute (full path) or
        relative to the <link to="IVirtualBox::homeFolder">VirtualBox home
        directory</link>.

        If @a baseFolder is a null or empty string (which is recommended), the
        <link to="ISystemProperties::defaultMachineFolder">default machine
        settings folder</link> will be used as a base folder for the created
        machine. Otherwise the given base folder will be used. In either case,
        the full path to the resulting settings file has the following
        structure:
        <pre>
          &lt;base_folder&gt;/&lt;machine_name&gt;/&lt;machine_name&gt;.xml
        </pre>

        Note that if the resulting settings file already exists, this method
        will fail with <link to="VBOX_E_FILE_ERROR"/>.

        Optionally, you may specify an UUID of to assign to the created machine.
        However, this is not recommended and you should normally pass an empty
        (null) UUID to this method so that a new UUID will be automatically
        generated for every created machine. You can use UUID
        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 as null value.

        <note>
          There is no way to change the name of the settings file or
          subfolder of the created machine directly.

    <method name="createLegacyMachine">
      <desc>
        Creates a new virtual machine in "legacy" mode, using the specified
        settings file to store machine settings.

        As opposed to machines created by <link to="#createMachine"/>,
        the settings file of the machine created in "legacy" mode is not
        automatically renamed when the machine name is changed -- it will always
        remain the same as specified in this method call.

        The specified settings file name can be absolute (full path) or relative
        to the <link to="IVirtualBox::homeFolder">VirtualBox home
        directory</link>. If the file name doesn't contain an extension, the
        default extension (.xml) will be appended.

        Note that the configuration of the newly created machine is not
        saved to disk (and therefore no settings file is created)
        until <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> is called. If the
        specified settings file already exists, this method
        will fail with <link to="VBOX_E_FILE_ERROR"/>..

        See <link to="#createMachine"/> for more information.

        @deprecated This method may be removed later. Use <link
        to="IVirtualBox::createMachine"/> instead.

        <note>
          There is no way to change the name of the settings file
          of the machine created in "legacy" mode.

    <method name="createHardDisk">
      <desc>
        Creates a new base hard disk object that will use the given storage
        format and location for hard disk data.

        Note that the actual storage unit is not created by this method. In
        order to do it, and before you are able to attach the created hard disk
        to virtual machines, you must call one of the following methods to
        allocate a format-specific storage unit at the specified location:
        <ul>
          <li><link to="IHardDisk::createDynamicStorage"/></li>
          <li><link to="IHardDisk::createFixedStorage"/></li>
          <li><link to="IHardDisk::createDiffStorage"/></li>
        </ul>

        Some hard disk attributes, such as <link to="IHardDisk::id"/>, may
        remain uninitialized until the hard disk storage unit is successfully
        created by one of the above methods.

        After the storage unit is successfully created, the hard disk gets
        remembered by this VirtualBox installation and will be accessible
        through <link to="#getHardDisk"/> and <link to="#findHardDisk"/>
        methods. Remembered root (base) hard disks are also returned as part of
        the <link to="#hardDisks"/> array. See IHardDisk for more details.

        The list of all storage formats supported by this VirtualBox
        installation can be obtained using
        <link to="ISystemProperties::hardDiskFormats"/>. If the @a format
        attribute is empty or <tt>null</tt> then the default storage format
        specified by <link to="ISystemProperties::defaultHardDiskFormat"/> will
        be used for creating a storage unit of the hard disk.

        Note that the format of the location string is storage format specific.
        See <link to="IMedium::location"/>, IHardDisk and
        <link to="ISystemProperties::defaultHardDiskFolder"/> for more details.

    <method name="openHardDisk">

        Opens a hard disk from an existing location.

        After the hard disk is successfully opened by this method, it gets
        remembered by (known to) this VirtualBox installation and will be
        accessible through <link to="#getHardDisk"/> and
        <link to="#findHardDisk"/> methods. Remembered root (base) hard disks
        are also returned as part of the <link to="#hardDisks"/> array and can
        be attached to virtual machines. See IHardDisk for more details.

        If a differencing hard disk is to be opened by this method, the
        operation will succeed only if its parent hard disk and all ancestors,
        if any, are already known to this VirtualBox installation (for example,
        were opened by this method before).

        This method tries to guess the storage format of the specified hard disk
        by reading hard disk data at the specified location.

        Note that the format of the location string is storage format specific.
        See <link to="IMedium::location"/>, IHardDisk and

    <method name="openSession">
      <desc>
        Opens a new direct session with the given virtual machine.

        A direct session acts as a local lock on the given VM.
        There can be only one direct session open at a time for every
        virtual machine, protecting the VM from being manipulated by
        conflicting actions from different processes. Only after a
        direct session has been opened, one can change all VM settings
        and execute the VM in the process space of the session object.

        Sessions therefore can be compared to mutex semaphores that
        lock a given VM for modification and execution.
        See <link to="ISession">ISession</link> for details.

        <note>Unless you are writing a new VM frontend, you will not
        want to execute a VM in the current process. To spawn a new
        process that executes a VM, use
        <link to="IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession" />
        instead.</note>

        Upon successful return, the session object can be used to
        get access to the machine and to the VM console.

        In VirtualBox terminology, the machine becomes "mutable" after
        a session has been opened. Note that the "mutable" machine
        object, on which you may invoke IMachine methods to change its
        settings, will be a different object from the immutable IMachine
        objects returned by various IVirtualBox methods. To obtain a
        mutable IMachine object (upon which you can invoke settings methods),
        use the <link to="ISession::machine" /> attribute.

        One must always call <link to="ISession::close" /> to release the
        lock on the machine, or the machine's state will eventually be
        set to "Aborted".

        In other words, to change settings on a machine, the following
        sequence is typically performed:

        <ol>
        <li>Call this method (openSession) to have a machine locked for
        the current session.</li>

        <li>Obtain a mutable IMachine object from <link to="ISession::machine" />.</li>

        <li>Change the settings of the machine.</li>

        <li>Call <link to="IMachine::saveSettings" />.</li>

        <li>Close the session by calling <link to="ISession::close"/>.</li>

    <method name="openRemoteSession">
      <desc>
        Spawns a new process that executes a virtual machine (called a
        "remote session").

        Opening a remote session causes the VirtualBox server to start a new
        process that opens a direct session with the given VM. As a result, the
        VM is locked by that direct session in the new process, preventing
        conflicting changes from other processes. Since sessions act as locks
        that prevent conflicting changes, one cannot open a remote session
        for a VM that already has another open session (direct or remote), or
        is currently in the process of opening one (see <link
          to="IMachine::sessionState"/>).

        While the remote session still provides some level of control over the
        VM execution to the caller (using the <link to="IConsole" /> interface),
        not all VM settings are available for modification within the remote
        session context.

        This operation can take some time (a new VM is started in a new process,
        for which memory and other resources need to be set up). Because of this,
        an <link to="IProgress" /> is returned to allow the caller to wait for this
        asynchronous operation to be completed. Until then, the remote session
        object remains in the closed state, and accessing the machine or its
        console through it is invalid. It is recommended to use
        <link to="IProgress::waitForCompletion" /> or similar calls to wait for
        completion.

        As with all <link to="ISession" /> objects, it is recommended to call
        <link to="ISession::close" /> on the local session object once openRemoteSession()
        has been called. However, the session's state (see <link to="ISession::state" />)
        will not return to "Closed" until the remote session has also closed (i.e.
        until the VM is no longer running). In that case, however, the state of
        the session will automatically change back to "Closed".

        Currently supported session types (values of the @a type
        argument) are:
        <ul>
          <li><tt>gui</tt>: VirtualBox Qt GUI session</li>
          <li><tt>vrdp</tt>: VirtualBox VRDP Server session</li>
        </ul>

        The @a environment argument is a string containing definitions of
        environment variables in the following format:
        @code
          NAME[=VALUE]\n
          NAME[=VALUE]\n
          ...
        @endcode
        where <tt>\\n</tt> is the new line character. These environment
        variables will be appended to the environment of the VirtualBox server
        process. If an environment variable exists both in the server process
        and in this list, the value from this list takes precedence over the
        server's variable. If the value of the environment variable is
        omitted, this variable will be removed from the resulting environment.
        If the environment string is @c null, the server environment is
        inherited by the started process as is.

    <method name="waitForPropertyChange">
      <desc>
        Blocks the caller until any of the properties represented by the
        @a what argument changes the value or until the given timeout interval
        expires.

        The @a what argument is a comma separated list of property masks that
        describe properties the caller is interested in. The property mask is
        a string in the following format:

        <pre>
        [[group.]subgroup.]name
        </pre>

        where @c name is the property name and @c group, @c subgroup are zero
        or more property group specifiers. Each element (group or name) in
        the property mask may be either a Latin string or an asterisk symbol
        (@c "*") which is used to match any string for the given element. A
        property mask that doesn't contain asterisk symbols represents a
        single fully qualified property name.

        Groups in the fully qualified property name go from more generic (the
        left-most part) to more specific (the right-most part). The first
        element is usually a name of the object the property belongs to.  The
        second element may be either a property name, or a child object name,
        or an index if the preceding element names an object which is one of
        many objects of the same type. This way, property names form a
        hierarchy of properties.  Here are some examples of property names:

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>VirtualBox.version</tt></td>
            <td><link to="IVirtualBox::version"/> property</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>Machine.&lt;UUID&gt;.name</tt></td>
            <td><link to="IMachine::name"/> property of the machine with the
            given UUID</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Most property names directly correspond to the properties of objects
        (components) provided by the VirtualBox library and may be used to
        track changes to these properties. However, there may be
        pseudo-property names that don't correspond to any existing object's
        property directly, as well as there may be object properties that
        don't have a corresponding property name that is understood by this
        method, and therefore changes to such properties cannot be
        tracked. See individual object's property descriptions to get a
        fully qualified property name that can be used with this method (if
        any).

        There is a special property mask @c "*" (i.e. a string consisting of a
        single asterisk symbol) that can be used to match all properties.

    <method name="saveSettings">
      <desc>
        Saves the global settings to the global settings file
        (<link to="#settingsFilePath"/>).

        This method is only useful for explicitly saving the global settings
        file after it has been auto-converted from the old format to the most
        recent format (see <link to="#settingsFileVersion"/> for details).
        Normally, the global settings file is implicitly saved when a global
        setting is changed.

        <result name="VBOX_E_FILE_ERROR">
          Settings file not accessible.
        </result>
        <result name="VBOX_E_XML_ERROR">
          Could not parse the settings file.
        </result>

      </desc>
    </method>

    <method name="saveSettingsWithBackup">
      <desc>
        Creates a backup copy of the global settings file
        (<link to="#settingsFilePath"/>) in case of auto-conversion, and then
        calls <link to="#saveSettings"/>.

        Note that the backup copy is created <b>only</b> if the settings file
        auto-conversion took place (see <link to="#settingsFileVersion"/> for
        details). Otherwise, this call is fully equivalent to
        <link to="#saveSettings"/> and no backup copying is done.

        The backup copy is created in the same directory where the original
        settings file is located. It is given the following file name:
        <pre>
          original.xml.x.y-platform.bak
        </pre>
        where <tt>original.xml</tt> is the original settings file name
        (excluding path), and <tt>x.y-platform</tt> is the version of the old
        format of the settings file (before auto-conversion).

        If the given backup file already exists, this method will try to add the
        <tt>.N</tt> suffix to the backup file name (where <tt>N</tt> counts from
        0 to 9) and copy it again until it succeeds. If all suffixes are
        occupied, or if any other copy error occurs, this method will return a
        failure.

        If the copy operation succeeds, the @a bakFileName return argument will
        receive a full path to the created backup file (for informational
        purposes). Note that this will happen even if the subsequent
        <link to="#saveSettings"/> call performed by this method after the
        copy operation, fails.

        <note>
          The VirtualBox API never calls this method. It is intended purely for
          the purposes of creating backup copies of the settings files by
          front-ends before saving the results of the automatically performed
          settings conversion to disk.

        Represents a platform-independent appliance in OVF format. An instance of this is returned
        by <link to="IVirtualBox::createAppliance" />, which can then be used to import and export
        appliances with VirtualBox.

        The OVF standard suggests two different physical file formats:

        <ol>
            <li>If the OVF is distributed as a set of files, then @a file must be a fully qualified
                path name to an existing OVF descriptor file with an <tt>.ovf</tt> file extension. If
                this descriptor file references other files, as OVF appliances distributed as a set of
                files most likely do, those files must be in the same directory as the descriptor file.</li>

            <li>If the OVF is distributed as a single file, it must be in TAR format and have the
                <tt>.ova</tt> file extension. This TAR file must then contain at least the OVF descriptor
                files and optionally other files.

                At this time, VirtualBox does not not yet support the packed (TAR) variant; support will
                be added with a later version.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Importing</b> an OVF appliance into VirtualBox as instances of
        <link to="IMachine" /> involves the following sequence of API calls:

        <ol>
          <li>Call <link to="IVirtualBox::createAppliance" />. This will create an empty IAppliance object.
          </li>

          <li>On the new object, call <link to="#read" /> with the full path of the OVF file you
              would like to import. So long as this file is syntactically valid, this will succeed
              and return an instance of IAppliance that contains the parsed data from the OVF file.
          </li>

          <li>Next, call <link to="#interpret" />, which analyzes the OVF data and sets up the
              contents of the IAppliance attributes accordingly. These can be inspected by a
              VirtualBox front-end such as the GUI, and the suggestions can be displayed to the
              user. In particular, the <link to="#virtualSystemDescriptions" /> array contains
              instances of <link to="IVirtualSystemDescription" /> which represent the virtual
              systems in the OVF, which in turn describe the virtual hardware prescribed by the
              OVF (network and hardware adapters, virtual disk images, memory size and so on).
              The GUI can then give the user the option to confirm and/or change these suggestions.
          </li>

          <li>If desired, call <link to="IVirtualSystemDescription::setFinalValues" /> for each
              virtual system to override the suggestions made by the interpret() routine.

        <b>Exporting</b> VirtualBox machines into an OVF appliance involves the following steps:

        <ol>
            <li>As with importing, first call <link to="IVirtualBox::createAppliance" /> to create
                an empty IAppliance object.
            </li>

            <li>For each machine you would like to export, call <link to="IMachine::export" />
                with the IAppliance object you just created. This creates an instance of
                <link to="IVirtualSystemDescription" /> inside the appliance.
            </li>

            <li>If desired, call <link to="IVirtualSystemDescription::setFinalValues" /> for each
                virtual system to override the suggestions made by the export() routine.
            </li>

            <li>Finally, call <link to="#write" /> with a path specification to have the OVF
                file written.</li>
        </ol>

        The caller should be prepared for additional fields being appended to

    <method name="getDescription">
      <desc>Returns information about the virtual system as arrays of instruction items. In each array, the
      items with the same indices correspond and jointly represent an import instruction for VirtualBox.

      The list below identifies the value sets that are possible depending on the
      <link to="VirtualSystemDescriptionType" /> enum value in the array item in aTypes[]. In each case,
      the array item with the same index in aOvfValues[] will contain the original value as contained
      in the OVF file (just for informational purposes), and the corresponding item in aVboxValues[]
      will contain a suggested value to be used for VirtualBox. Depending on the description type,
      the aExtraConfigValues[] array item may also be used.

      <ul>
      <li>
        "OS": the guest operating system type. There must be exactly one such array item on import. The
        corresponding item in aVboxValues[] contains the suggested guest operating system for VirtualBox.
        This will be one of the values listed in <link to="IVirtualBox::guestOSTypes" />. The corresponding
        item in aOvfValues[] will contain a numerical value that described the operating system in the OVF
        (see <link to="CIMOSType" />).
      </li>
      <li>
        "Name": the name to give to the new virtual machine. There can be at most one such array item;
        if none is present on import, then an automatic name will be created from the operating system
        type. The correponding item im aOvfValues[] will contain the suggested virtual machine name
        from the OVF file, and aVboxValues[] will contain a suggestion for a unique VirtualBox
        <link to="IMachine" /> name that does not exist yet.
      </li>
      <li>
        "CPU": the number of CPUs. There can be at most one such item, which will presently be ignored.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Memory": the amount of guest RAM, in bytes. There can be at most one such array item; if none
        is present on import, then VirtualBox will set a meaningful default based on the operating system
        type.
      </li>
      <li>
        "HarddiskControllerIDE": an IDE hard disk controller. There can be at most one such item. This
        has no value in aOvfValues[] or aVboxValues[].
        The matching item in the aRefs[] array will contain an integer that items of the "Harddisk"
        type can use to specify which hard disk controller a virtual disk should be connected to.
      </li>
      <li>
        "HarddiskControllerSATA": an SATA hard disk controller. There can be at most one such item. This
        has no value in aOvfValues[] or aVboxValues[].
        The matching item in the aRefs[] array will be used as with IDE controllers (see above).
      </li>
      <li>
        "HarddiskControllerSCSI": a SCSI hard disk controller. There can be at most one such item.
        The items in aOvfValues[] and aVboxValues[] will either be "LsiLogic" or "BusLogic".
        The matching item in the aRefs[] array will be used as with IDE controllers (see above).
      </li>
      <li>
        "HardDiskImage": a virtual hard disk, most probably as a reference to an image file. There can be an
        arbitrary number of these items, one for each virtual disk image that accompanies the OVF.

        The array item in aOvfValues[] will contain the file specification from the OVF file (without
        a path since the image file should be in the same location as the OVF file itself), whereas the
        item in aVboxValues[] will contain a qualified path specification to where VirtualBox uses the
        hard disk image. This means that on import the image will be copied and converted from the
        "ovf" location to the "vbox" location; on export, this will be handled the other way round.
        On import, the target image will also be registered with VirtualBox.

        The matching item in the aExtraConfigValues[] array must contain a string of the following
        format: "controller=&lt;index&gt;;channel=&lt;c&gt;"
        In this string, &lt;index&gt; must be an integer specifying the hard disk controller to connect
        the image to. That number must be the index of an array item with one of the hard disk controller
        types (HarddiskControllerSCSI, HarddiskControllerSATA, HarddiskControllerIDE).
        In addition, &lt;c&gt; must specify the channel to use on that controller. For IDE controllers,
        this can range from 0-2 (which VirtualBox will interpret as primary master, primary slave,
        secondary slave; VirtualBox reserves the secondary master for the CD-ROM drive). For SATA and
        SCSI conrollers, the channel can range from 0-29.
      </li>
      <li>
        "NetworkAdapter": a network adapter. The array item in aVboxValues[] will specify the hardware
        for the network adapter, whereas the array item in aExtraConfigValues[] will have a string
        of the "type=&lt;X&gt;" format, where &lt;X&gt; must be either "NAT" or "Bridged".
      </li>
      <li>
          "USBController": a USB controller. There can be at most one such item. If and only if such an
          item ispresent, USB support will be enabled for the new virtual machine.
      </li>
      <li>
          "SoundCard": a sound card. There can be at most one such item. If and only if such an item is
          present, sound support will be enabled for the new virtual machine. Note that the virtual
          machine in VirtualBox will always be presented with the standard VirtualBox soundcard, which
          may be different from the virtual soundcard expected by the appliance.

        This method allows the appliance's user to change the configuration for the virtual
        system descriptions. For each array item returned from <link to="getDescription" />,
        you must pass in one boolean value and one configuration value.

        Each item in the boolean array determines whether the particular configuration item
        should be enabled.
        You can only disable items of the types HardDiskControllerIDE, HardDiskControllerSATA,
        HardDiskControllerSCSI, HardDiskImage, CDROM, Floppy, NetworkAdapter, USBController
        and SoundCard.

        For the "vbox" and "extra configuration" values, if you pass in the same arrays
        as returned in the aVboxValues and aExtraConfigValues arrays from getDescription(),
        the configuration remains unchanged. Please see the documentation for getDescription()
        for valid configuration values for the individual array item types. If the

    <desc>
      The IMachine interface represents a virtual machine, or guest, created
      in VirtualBox.

      This interface is used in two contexts. First of all, a collection of
      objects implementing this interface is stored in the
      <link to="IVirtualBox::machines"/> attribute which lists all the virtual
      machines that are currently registered with this VirtualBox
      installation. Also, once a session has been opened for the given virtual
      machine (e.g. the virtual machine is running), the machine object
      associated with the open session can be queried from the session object;
      see <link to="ISession"/> for details.

      The main role of this interface is to expose the settings of the virtual
      machine and provide methods to change various aspects of the virtual
      machine's configuration. For machine objects stored in the
      <link to="IVirtualBox::machines"/> collection, all attributes are
      read-only unless explicitly stated otherwise in individual attribute
      and method descriptions. In order to change a machine setting, a session
      for this machine must be opened using one of
      <link to="IVirtualBox::openSession"/>,
      <link to="IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession"/> or
      <link to="IVirtualBox::openExistingSession"/> methods. After the
      session has been successfully opened, a mutable machine object needs to
      be queried from the session object and then the desired settings changes
      can be applied to the returned object using IMachine attributes and
      methods. See the ISession interface description for more information
      about sessions.

      Note that the IMachine interface does not provide methods to control
      virtual machine execution (such as start the machine, or power it
      down) -- these methods are grouped in a separate IConsole
      interface. Refer to the IConsole interface description to get more
      information about this topic.

    <attribute name="parent" type="IVirtualBox" readonly="yes">
      <desc>Associated parent object.</desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="accessible" type="boolean" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Whether this virtual machine is currently accessible or not.

        The machine is considered to be inaccessible when:
        <ul>
          <li>It is a registered virtual machine, and
          </li>
          <li>Its settings file is inaccessible (for example, it is
            located on a network share that is not accessible during
            VirtualBox startup, or becomes inaccessible later, or if
            the settings file can be read but is invalid).
          </li>
        </ul>

        Otherwise, the value of this property is always <tt>true</tt>.

        Every time this property is read, the accessibility state of
        this machine is re-evaluated. If the returned value is |false|,
        the <link to="#accessError"/> property may be used to get the
        detailed error information describing the reason of
        inaccessibility.

        When the machine is inaccessible, only the following properties
        can be used on it:
        <ul>
          <li><link to="#parent"/></li>
          <li><link to="#id"/></li>
          <li><link to="#settingsFilePath"/></li>
          <li><link to="#accessible"/></li>
          <li><link to="#accessError"/></li>
        </ul>

        An attempt to access any other property or method will return
        an error.

        The only possible action you can perform on an inaccessible
        machine is to unregister it using the
        <link to="IVirtualBox::unregisterMachine"/> call (or, to check
        for the accessibility state once more by querying this
        property).

        <note>
          In the current implementation, once this property returns
          <tt>true</tt>, the machine will never become inaccessible
          later, even if its settings file cannot be successfully
          read/written any more (at least, until the VirtualBox
          server is restarted). This limitation may be removed in
          future releases.
        </note>
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="accessError" type="IVirtualBoxErrorInfo" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Error information describing the reason of machine
        inaccessibility.

        Reading this property is only valid after the last call to
        <link to="#accessible"/> returned <tt>false</tt> (i.e. the
        machine is currently unaccessible). Otherwise, a null
        IVirtualBoxErrorInfo object will be returned.
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="name" type="wstring">
      <desc>
        Name of the virtual machine.

        Besides being used for human-readable identification purposes
        everywhere in VirtualBox, the virtual machine name is also used
        as a name of the machine's settings file and as a name of the
        subdirectory this settings file resides in. Thus, every time you
        change the value of this property, the settings file will be
        renamed once you call <link to="#saveSettings"/> to confirm the
        change. The containing subdirectory will be also renamed, but
        only if it has exactly the same name as the settings file
        itself prior to changing this property (for backward compatibility
        with previous API releases). The above implies the following
        limitations:
        <ul>
          <li>The machine name cannot be empty.</li>
          <li>The machine name can contain only characters that are valid
            file name characters according to the rules of the file
            system used to store VirtualBox configuration.</li>
          <li>You cannot have two or more machines with the same name
            if they use the same subdirectory for storing the machine
            settings files.</li>
          <li>You cannot change the name of the machine if it is running,
            or if any file in the directory containing the settings file
            is being used by another running machine or by any other
            process in the host operating system at a time when
            <link to="#saveSettings"/> is called.
          </li>
        </ul>
        If any of the above limitations are hit, <link to="#saveSettings"/>
        will return an appropriate error message explaining the exact
        reason and the changes you made to this machine will not be
        saved.
        <note>
          For "legacy" machines created using the
          <link to="IVirtualBox::createLegacyMachine"/> call,
          the above naming limitations do not apply because the
          machine name does not affect the settings file name.
          The settings file name remains the same as it was specified
          during machine creation and never changes.

      <desc>
        Current version of the format of the settings file of this machine
        (<link to="#settingsFilePath"/>).

        The version string has the following format:
        <pre>
          x.y-platform
        </pre>
        where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are the major and the minor format
        versions, and <tt>platform</tt> is the platform identifier.

        The current version usually matches the value of the
        <link to="IVirtualBox::settingsFormatVersion"/> attribute unless the
        settings file was created by an older version of VirtualBox and there
        was a change of the settings file format since then.

        Note that VirtualBox automatically converts settings files from older
        versions to the most recent version when reading them (usually at
        VirtualBox startup) but it doesn't save the changes back until
        you call a method that implicitly saves settings (such as
        <link to="#setExtraData"/>) or call <link to="#saveSettings"/>
        explicitly. Therefore, if the value of this attribute differs from the
        value of <link to="IVirtualBox::settingsFormatVersion"/>, then it
        means that the settings file was converted but the result of the
        conversion is not yet saved to disk.

        The above feature may be used by interactive front-ends to inform users
        about the settings file format change and offer them to explicitly save
        all converted settings files (the global and VM-specific ones),
        optionally create backup copies of the old settings files before saving,

        For the IDE bus, the @a controllerPort parameter can be either

        respectively. For the primary controller of the IDE bus,
        @a device can be either @c 0 or @c 1, to specify the master or the
        slave device, respectively. For the secondary IDE controller, the
        device number must be @c 1 because VirtualBox reserves the
        secondary master for the CD-ROM drive.

        For an SATA controller, @a controllerPort must be a number ranging
        from @c 0 to @c 29. For a SCSI controller, @a controllerPort must
        be a number ranging from @c 0 to @c 15.

        For both SCSI and SATA, the @a device parameter is unused and must
        be @c 0.

        The specified device slot must not have another disk attached to it, or
        this method will fail.

    <method name="saveSettingsWithBackup">
      <desc>
        Creates a backup copy of the machine settings file (<link
        to="#settingsFilePath"/>) in case of auto-conversion, and then calls
        <link to="#saveSettings"/>.

        Note that the backup copy is created <b>only</b> if the settings file
        auto-conversion took place (see <link to="#settingsFileVersion"/> for
        details). Otherwise, this call is fully equivalent to
        <link to="#saveSettings"/> and no backup copying is done.

        The backup copy is created in the same directory where the original
        settings file is located. It is given the following file name:
        <pre>
          original.xml.x.y-platform.bak
        </pre>
        where <tt>original.xml</tt> is the original settings file name
        (excluding path), and <tt>x.y-platform</tt> is the version of the old
        format of the settings file (before auto-conversion).

        If the given backup file already exists, this method will try to add the
        <tt>.N</tt> suffix to the backup file name (where <tt>N</tt> counts from
        0 to 9) and copy it again until it succeeds. If all suffixes are
        occupied, or if any other copy error occurs, this method will return a
        failure.

        If the copy operation succeeds, the @a bakFileName return argument will
        receive a full path to the created backup file (for informational
        purposes). Note that this will happen even if the subsequent
        <link to="#saveSettings"/> call performed by this method after the
        copy operation, fails.

        <note>
          The VirtualBox API never calls this method. It is intended purely for
          the purposes of creating backup copies of the settings files by
          front-ends before saving the results of the automatically performed
          settings conversion to disk.

        <desc>
          Address of the shape buffer.

          The @a shape buffer contains a 1-bpp (bits per pixel) AND mask
          followed by a 32-bpp XOR (color) mask.

          For pointers without alpha channel the XOR mask pixels are 32
          bit values: (lsb)BGR0(msb). For pointers with alpha channel
          the XOR mask consists of (lsb)BGRA(msb) 32 bit values.

          An AND mask is used for pointers with alpha channel, so if the
          callback does not support alpha, the pointer could be
          displayed as a normal color pointer.

          The AND mask is a 1-bpp bitmap with byte aligned scanlines. The
          size of the AND mask therefore is <tt>cbAnd = (width + 7) / 8 *
          height</tt>. The padding bits at the end of each scanline are
          undefined.

          The XOR mask follows the AND mask on the next 4-byte aligned
          offset: <tt>uint8_t *pXor = pAnd + (cbAnd + 3) &amp; ~3</tt>.
          Bytes in the gap between the AND and the XOR mask are undefined.
          The XOR mask scanlines have no gap between them and the size of
          the XOR mask is: <tt>cXor = width * 4 * height</tt>.

          <note>
            If @a shape is 0, only the pointer visibility is changed.

    <method name="onRuntimeError">
      <desc>
        Notification when an error happens during the virtual
        machine execution.

        There are three kinds of runtime errors:
        <ul>
          <li><i>fatal</i></li>
          <li><i>non-fatal with retry</i></li>
          <li><i>non-fatal warnings</i></li>
        </ul>

        <b>Fatal</b> errors are indicated by the @a fatal parameter set
        to <tt>true</tt>. In case of fatal errors, the virtual machine
        execution is always paused before calling this notification, and
        the notification handler is supposed either to immediately save
        the virtual machine state using <link to="IConsole::saveState"/>
        or power it off using <link to="IConsole::powerDown"/>.
        Resuming the execution can lead to unpredictable results.

        <b>Non-fatal</b> errors and warnings are indicated by the
        @a fatal parameter set to <tt>false</tt>. If the virtual machine
        is in the Paused state by the time the error notification is
        received, it means that the user can <i>try to resume</i> the machine
        execution after attempting to solve the problem that caused the
        error. In this case, the notification handler is supposed
        to show an appropriate message to the user (depending on the
        value of the @a id parameter) that offers several actions such
        as <i>Retry</i>, <i>Save</i> or <i>Power Off</i>. If the user
        wants to retry, the notification handler should continue
        the machine execution using the <link to="IConsole::resume"/>
        call. If the machine execution is not Paused during this
        notification, then it means this notification is a <i>warning</i>
        (for example, about a fatal condition that can happen very soon);
        no immediate action is required from the user, the machine
        continues its normal execution.

        Note that in either case the notification handler
        <b>must not</b> perform any action directly on a thread
        where this notification is called. Everything it is allowed to
        do is to post a message to another thread that will then talk
        to the user and take the corresponding action.

        Currently, the following error identifiers are known:
        <ul>
          <li><tt>"HostMemoryLow"</tt></li>
          <li><tt>"HostAudioNotResponding"</tt></li>
          <li><tt>"VDIStorageFull"</tt></li>
        </ul>

        <note>
          This notification is not designed to be implemented by
          more than one callback at a time. If you have multiple
          IConsoleCallback instances registered on the given
          IConsole object, make sure you simply do nothing but
          return @c S_OK from all but one of them that does actual
          user notification and performs necessary actions.

        requests the console window to be activated and brought to
        foreground on the desktop of the host PC.

        This notification should cause the VM console process to
        perform the requested action as described above. If it is
        impossible to do it at a time of this notification, this
        method should return a failure.

        Note that many modern window managers on many platforms
        implement some sort of focus stealing prevention logic, so
        that it may be impossible to activate a window without the
        help of the currently active application (which is supposedly
        an initiator of this notification). In this case, this method
        must return a non-zero identifier that represents the
        top-level window of the VM console process. The caller, if it
        represents a currently active process, is responsible to use
        this identifier (in a platform-dependent manner) to perform
        actual window activation.

        This method must set @a winId to zero if it has performed all
        actions necessary to complete the request and the console
        window is now active and in foreground, to indicate that no
        further action is required on the caller's side.

      The IConsole interface represents an interface to control virtual
      machine execution.

      The console object that implements the IConsole interface is obtained
      from a session object after the session for the given machine has been
      opened using one of <link to="IVirtualBox::openSession"/>,
      <link to="IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession"/> or
      <link to="IVirtualBox::openExistingSession"/> methods.

      Methods of the IConsole interface allow the caller to query the current
      virtual machine execution state, pause the machine or power it down, save
      the machine state or take a snapshot, attach and detach removable media
      and so on.

        Starts the virtual machine execution using the current machine

        If the machine is powered off or aborted, the execution will
        start from the beginning (as if the real hardware were just
        powered on).

        If the machine is in the <link to="MachineState_Saved"/> state,
        it will continue its execution the point where the state has
        been saved.

        <note>
          Unless you are trying to write a new VirtualBox front-end that
          performs direct machine execution (like the VirtualBox or VBoxSDL
          front-ends), don't call <link to="IConsole::powerUp"/> in a direct
          session opened by <link to="IVirtualBox::openSession"/> and use this
          session only to change virtual machine settings. If you simply want to
          start virtual machine execution using one of the existing front-ends
          (for example the VirtualBox GUI or headless server), simply use
          <link to="IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession"/>; these front-ends will
          power up the machine automatically for you.

    <method name="saveState">

        Saves the current execution state of a running virtual machine

        After this operation completes, the machine will go to the
        Saved state. Next time it is powered up, this state will
        be restored and the machine will continue its execution from
        the place where it was saved.

        This operation differs from taking a snapshot to the effect
        that it doesn't create new differencing hard disks. Also, once
        the machine is powered up from the state saved using this method,
        the saved state is deleted, so it will be impossible to return
        to this state later.

        <note>
          On success, this method implicitly calls
          <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> to save all current machine
          settings (including runtime changes to the DVD drive, etc.).
          Together with the impossibility to change any VM settings when it is
          in the Saved state, this guarantees adequate hardware
          configuration of the machine when it is restored from the saved
          state file.

        Saves the current execution state and all settings of the

        This method can be called for a PoweredOff, Saved, Running or

        offline <link to="ISnapshot">snapshot</link> is created,

        The taken snapshot is always based on the

        a new current snapshot.

        <note>
          This method implicitly calls <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> to

    <method name="discardSnapshot">
      <desc>

        Starts discarding the specified snapshot. The execution state
        and settings of the associated machine stored in the snapshot
        will be deleted. The contents of all differencing hard disks of
        this snapshot will be merged with the contents of their
        dependent child hard disks to keep the, disks valid (in other
        words, all changes represented by hard disks being discarded
        will be propagated to their child hard disks). After that, this
        snapshot's differencing hard disks will be deleted. The parent
        of this snapshot will become a new parent for all its child
        snapshots.

        If the discarded snapshot is the current one, its parent
        snapshot will become a new current snapshot. The current machine
        state is not directly affected in this case, except that
        currently attached differencing hard disks based on hard disks
        of the discarded snapshot will be also merged as described
        above.

        If the discarded snapshot is the first one (the root snapshot)
        and it has exactly one child snapshot, this child snapshot will
        become the first snapshot after discarding. If there are no
        children at all (i.e. the first snapshot is the only snapshot of
        the machine), both the current and the first snapshot of the
        machine will be set to null. In all other cases, the first
        snapshot cannot be discarded.

        You cannot discard the snapshot if it
        stores <link to="HardDiskType_Normal">normal</link> (non-differencing)
        hard disks that have differencing hard disks based on them. Snapshots of
        such kind can be discarded only when every normal hard disk has either
        no children at all or exactly one child. In the former case, the normal
        hard disk simply becomes unused (i.e. not attached to any VM). In the
        latter case, it receives all the changes stored in the child hard disk,
        and then it replaces the child hard disk in the configuration of the
        corresponding snapshot or machine.

        Also, you cannot discard the snapshot if it stores hard disks
        (of any type) having differencing child hard disks that belong
        to other machines. Such snapshots can be only discarded after
        you discard all snapshots of other machines containing "foreign"
        child disks, or detach these "foreign" child disks from machines
        they are attached to.

        One particular example of the snapshot storing normal hard disks
        is the first snapshot of a virtual machine that had normal hard
        disks attached when taking the snapshot. Be careful when
        discarding such snapshots because this implicitly commits
        changes (made since the snapshot being discarded has been taken)
        to normal hard disks (as described above), which may be not what
        you want.

        The virtual machine is put to
        the <link to="MachineState_Discarding">Discarding</link> state until
        the discard operation is completed.

        <note>
          The machine must not be running, otherwise the operation
          will fail.
        </note>

        <note>
          Child hard disks of all normal hard disks of the discarded snapshot
          must be accessible (see <link to="IMedium::state"/>) for this
          operation to succeed.  In particular, this means that all virtual
          machines, whose hard disks are directly or indirectly based on the
          hard disks of discarded snapshot, must be powered off.
        </note>
        <note>
          Merging hard disk contents can be very time and disk space
          consuming, if these disks are big in size and have many
          children. However, if the snapshot being discarded is the last
          (head) snapshot on the branch, the operation will be rather
          quick.
        </note>
        <note>
          Note that discarding the current snapshot
          will implicitly call <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> to
          make all current machine settings permanent.

        This operation is similar to <link to="#discardSnapshot"/> but
        affects the current machine state. This means that the state stored in
        the current snapshot will become a new current state, and all current
        settings of the machine and changes stored in differencing hard disks
        will be lost.

        After this operation is successfully completed, new empty differencing
        hard disks are created for all normal hard disks of the machine.

        If the current snapshot of the machine is an online snapshot, the
        machine will go to the <link to="MachineState_Saved"> saved
        state</link>, so that the next time it is powered on, the execution
        state will be restored from the current snapshot.

        <note>
          If the machine state is <link to="MachineState_Saved">Saved</link>
          prior to this operation, the saved state file will be implicitly

    <method name="discardCurrentSnapshotAndState">
      <desc>

        This method is equivalent to
        doing <link to="IConsole::discardSnapshot">discardSnapshot</link>
        (currentSnapshot.id(), progress) followed by
        <link to="#discardCurrentState"/>.

        As a result, the machine will be fully restored from the
        snapshot preceding the current snapshot, while both the current
        snapshot and the current machine state will be discarded.

        If the current snapshot is the first snapshot of the machine (i.e. it
        has the only snapshot), the current machine state will be
        discarded <b>before</b> discarding the snapshot. In other words, the
        machine will be restored from its last snapshot, before discarding
        it. This differs from performing a single
        <link to="#discardSnapshot"/> call (note that no
        <link to="#discardCurrentState"/> will be possible after it)
        to the effect that the latter will preserve the current state instead of
        discarding it.

        Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, all remarks and
        limitations of the above two methods also apply to this method.

        <note>
          The machine must not be running, otherwise the operation
          will fail.
        </note>

        <note>
          If the machine state is <link to="MachineState_Saved">Saved</link>

          discarded (as if <link to="#discardSavedState"/> were
          called).
        </note>

        <note>
          This method is more efficient than calling both of the above
          methods separately: it requires less IPC calls and provides
          a single progress object.

      <desc>
        List of all hard disk storage formats supported by this VirtualBox
        installation.

        Keep in mind that the hard disk format identifier
        (<link to="IHardDiskFormat::id"/>) used in other API calls like
        <link to="IVirtualBox::createHardDisk"/> to refer to a particular
        hard disk format is a case-insensitive string. This means that, for
        example, all of the following strings:
        <pre>
          "VDI"
          "vdi"
          "VdI"</pre>
        refer to the same hard disk format.

        Note that the virtual hard disk framework is backend-based, therefore
        the list of supported formats depends on what backends are currently
        installed.

    <attribute name="defaultHardDiskFormat" type="wstring">
      <desc>
        Identifier of the default hard disk format used by VirtualBox.

        The hard disk format set by this attribute is used by VirtualBox
        when the hard disk format was not specified explicitly. One example is
        <link to="IVirtualBox::createHardDisk"/> with the <tt>null</tt>
        format argument. A more complex example is implicit creation of
        differencing hard disks when taking a snapshot of a virtual machine:
        this operation will try to use a format of the parent hard disk first
        and if this format does not support differencing hard disks the default
        format specified by this argument will be used.

        The list of supported hard disk formats may be obtained by the
        <link  to="#hardDiskFormats"/> call. Note that the default hard disk
        format must have a capability to create differencing hard disks;
        otherwise opeartions that create hard disks implicitly may fail
        unexpectedly.

        The initial value of this property is <tt>VDI</tt> in the current
        version of the VirtualBox product, but may change in the future.

        <note>
          Setting this property to <tt>null</tt> will restore the
          initial value.

        in the VM RemoteDisplay configuration.

        The system library extension (".DLL" or ".so") must be omitted.
        A full path can be specified; if not, then the library must reside on the
        system's default library path.

        Library that provides authentication for webservice clients. The library

        in the VM RemoteDisplay configuration and will be called from
        within the <link to="IWebsessionManager::logon" /> implementation.

        As opposed to <link to="ISystemProperties::remoteDisplayAuthLibrary" />,
        there is no per-VM setting for this, as the webservice is a global
        resource (if it is running). Only for this setting (for the webservice),
        setting this value to a literal "null" string disables authentication,
        meaning that <link to="IWebsessionManager::logon" /> will always succeed,
        no matter what user name and password are supplied.

        The initial value of this property is <tt>VRDPAuth</tt>,
        meaning that the webservice will use the same authentication
        library that is used by default for VBoxVRDP (again, see

  <interface
     name="ISnapshot" extends="$unknown"

     wsmap="managed"
     >
    <desc>
      The ISnapshot interface represents a snapshot of the virtual
      machine.

      The <i>snapshot</i> stores all the information about a virtual
      machine necessary to bring it to exactly the same state as it was at
      the time of taking the snapshot. The snapshot includes:

      <ul>
        <li>all settings of the virtual machine (i.e. its hardware
          configuration: RAM size, attached hard disks, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>the execution state of the virtual machine (memory contents,
          CPU state, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>

      Snapshots can be <i>offline</i> (taken when the VM is powered off)
      or <i>online</i> (taken when the VM is running). The execution
      state of the offline snapshot is called a <i>zero execution state</i>
      (it doesn't actually contain any information about memory contents
      or the CPU state, assuming that all hardware is just powered off).

      <h3>Snapshot branches</h3>

      Snapshots can be chained. Chained snapshots form a branch where
      every next snapshot is based on the previous one. This chaining is
      mostly related to hard disk branching (see <link to="IHardDisk"/>
      description). This means that every time a new snapshot is created,
      a new differencing hard disk is implicitly created for all normal
      hard disks attached to the given virtual machine. This allows to
      fully restore hard disk contents when the machine is later reverted
      to a particular snapshot.

      In the current implementation, multiple snapshot branches within one
      virtual machine are not allowed. Every machine has a single branch,
      and <link to="IConsole::takeSnapshot"/> operation adds a new
      snapshot to the top of that branch.

      Existing snapshots can be discarded using
      <link to="IConsole::discardSnapshot"/>.

      <h3>Current snapshot</h3>

      Every virtual machine has a current snapshot, identified by
      <link to="IMachine::currentSnapshot"/>. This snapshot is used as
      a base for the <i>current machine state</i> (see below), to the effect
      that all normal hard disks of the machine and its execution
      state are based on this snapshot.

      In the current implementation, the current snapshot is always the
      last taken snapshot (i.e. the head snapshot on the branch) and it
      cannot be changed.

      The current snapshot is <tt>null</tt> if the machine doesn't have
      snapshots at all; in this case the current machine state is just
      current settings of this machine plus its current execution state.

      <h3>Current machine state</h3>

      The current machine state is what represented by IMachine instances got
      directly from IVirtualBox
      using <link
      to="IVirtualBox::getMachine">getMachine()</link>, <link
      to="IVirtualBox::findMachine">findMachine()</link>, etc. (as opposed
      to instances returned by <link to="ISnapshot::machine"/>).  This state
      is always used when the machine is <link to="IConsole::powerUp"> powered
      on</link>.

      The current machine state also includes the current execution state.
      If the machine is being currently executed
      (<link to="IMachine::state"/> is <link to="MachineState_Running"/>
      and above), its execution state is just what's happening now.
      If it is powered off (<link to="MachineState_PoweredOff"/> or
      <link to="MachineState_Aborted"/>), it has a zero execution state.
      If the machine is saved (<link to="MachineState_Saved"/>), its
      execution state is what saved in the execution state file
      (<link to="IMachine::stateFilePath"/>).

      If the machine is in the saved state, then, next time it is powered
      on, its execution state will be fully restored from the saved state
      file and the execution will continue from the point where the state
      was saved.

      Similarly to snapshots, the current machine state can be discarded
      using <link to="IConsole::discardCurrentState"/>.

      <h3>Taking and discarding snapshots</h3>

      The table below briefly explains the meaning of every snapshot
      operation:

      <table>
        <tr><th>Operation</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Remarks</th></tr>

        <tr><td><link to="IConsole::takeSnapshot"/></td>

            settings, contents of normal hard disks and the current modifications
            to immutable hard disks (for online snapshots)</td>

          <td>The current state is not changed (the machine will continue
            execution if it is being executed when the snapshot is
            taken)</td></tr>

        <tr><td><link to="IConsole::discardSnapshot"/></td>

          <td>Forget the state of the virtual machine stored in the snapshot:
            dismiss all saved settings and delete the saved execution state (for
            online snapshots)</td>

          <td>Other snapshots (including child snapshots, if any) and the

      The IMedium interface is a common interface for all objects representing
      virtual media such as hard disks, DVD images.

      Each medium is associated with a storage unit (such as a file on the host
      computer or a network resource) that holds actual data. The location of
      the storage unit is represented by the #location attribute. The value of
      this attribute is media type dependent.

      The exact media type may be determined by querying the appropriate
      interface such as:
      <ul>
        <li>IHardDisk (virtual hard disks)</li>
        <li>IDVDImage (standard CD/DVD ISO image files)</li>
        <li>IFloppyImage (raw floppy image files)</li>
      </ul>

      Existing media are opened using the following methods, depending on the
      media type:
      <ul>
        <li><link to="IVirtualBox::openHardDisk"/></li>
        <li><link to="IVirtualBox::openDVDImage"/></li>
        <li><link to="IVirtualBox::openFloppyImage"/></li>
      </ul>

      New hard disk media are created using the
      <link to="IVirtualBox::createHardDisk"/> method. CD/DVD and floppy
      images are created outside VirtualBox, usually by storing a copy
      of the real medium of the corresponding type in a regular file.

      <h3>Known Media</h3>

      When an existing medium gets opened for the first time, it gets
      automatically remembered by the given VirtualBox installation or, in other
      words, becomes a <i>known medium</i>. Known media are stored in the media
      registry transparently maintained by VirtualBox and stored in settings
      files so that this registry is preserved when VirtualBox is not running.

      Newly created virtual hard disks get remembered only when the associated
      storage unit is actually created (see IHardDisk for more details).

      All known media can be enumerated using
      <link to="IVirtualBox::hardDisks"/>,
      <link to="IVirtualBox::DVDImages"/> and
      <link to="IVirtualBox::floppyImages"/> attributes. Individual media can be
      quickly found by UUID using <link to="IVirtualBox::getHardDisk"/>
      and similar methods or by location using
      <link to="IVirtualBox::findHardDisk"/> and similar methods.

      Only known media can be attached to virtual machines.

      Removing known media from the media registry is performed when the given
      medium is closed using the <link to="#close"/> method or when its
      associated storage unit is deleted (only for hard disks).

      <h3>Accessibility Checks</h3>

      The given medium (with the created storage unit) is considered to be
      <i>accessible</i> when its storage unit can be successfully read from.
      Accessible media are indicated by the <link to="MediaState_Created"/>
      value of the <link to="#state"/> attribute. When the storage unit cannot
      be read (for example, because it is located on a disconnected network
      resource, or was accidentally deleted outside VirtualBox), the medium is
      considered to be <i>inaccessible</i> which is indicated by the
      <link to="MediaState_Inaccessible"/> state. The details about the reason
      of being inaccessible can be obtained using the
      <link to="#lastAccessError"/> attribute.

      A new accessibility check is performed each time the <link to="#state"/>
      attribute is read. Please note that this check may take long time (several
      seconds or even minutes, depending on the storage unit location and
      format), and will block the calling thread until finished. For this
      reason, it is recommended to never read this attribute on the main UI
      thread to avoid making the UI unresponsive.

      Note that when VirtualBox starts up (e.g. the VirtualBox object gets
      created for the first time), all known media are in the
      <link to="MediaState_Inaccessible"/> state but the value of the <link
      to="#lastAccessError"/> attribute is <tt>null</tt> because no actual
      accessibility check is made on startup. This is done to make the
      VirtualBox object ready for serving requests as
      fast as possible and let the end-user application decide if it needs to
      check media accessibility right away or not.
    </desc>

    <attribute name="id" type="uuid" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        UUID of the medium. For a newly created medium, this value is a randomly
        generated UUID.

        <note>
          For media in one of MediaState_NotCreated, MediaState_Creating or
          MediaState_Deleting states, the value of this property is undefined
          and will most likely be an empty UUID.
        </note>
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="description" type="wstring">
      <desc>
        Optional description of the medium. For newly created media, the value
        of this attribute value is <tt>null</tt>.

        Media types that don't support this attribute will return E_NOTIMPL in
        attempt to get or set this attribute's value.

        <note>
          For some storage types, reading this attribute may return an outdated
          (last known) value when <link to="#state"/> is <link
          to="MediaState_Inaccessible"/> or <link
          to="MediaState_LockedWrite"/> because the value of this attribute is
          stored within the storage unit itself. Also note that changing the
          attribute value is not possible in such case, as well as when the
          medium is the <link to="MediaState_LockedRead"/> state.
        </note>
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="state" type="MediaState" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Current media state. Inspect <link to="MediaState"/> values for details.

        Reading this attribute may take long time because a new accessibility
        check of the storage unit is performed every time the attribute is read.
        This check may cause a significant delay if the storage unit of the
        given medium is, for example, a file located on a network share which is
        not currently accessible due to connectivity problems -- the call will
        not return until a timeout interval defined by the host OS for this
        operation expires.

        If the last known state of the medium is <link to="MediaState_Created"/>
        and the accessibility check fails then the state would be set to
        <link to="MediaState_Inaccessible"/> and <link to="#lastAccessError"/>
        may be used to get more details about the failure. If the state of the
        medium is <link to="MediaState_LockedRead"/> or
        <link to="MediaState_LockedWrite"/> then it remains the same, and a
        non-null value of <link to="#lastAccessError"/> will indicate a failed
        accessibility check in this case.

        Note that not all media states are applicable to certain media types.
        For example, states <link to="MediaState_NotCreated"/>,
        <link to="MediaState_LockedWrite"/>, <link to="MediaState_Creating"/>,
        <link to="MediaState_Deleting"/> are meaningless for IDVDImage and
        IFloppyImage media.
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="location" type="wstring">
      <desc>
        Location of the storage unit holding media data.

        The format of the location string is media type specific. For media
        types that use regular files in a host's file system, the location
        string is just a full file name.

        Some media types may support changing the storage unit location by
        simply changing the value of this property. If this operation is not
        supported, the implementation will return E_NOTIMPL in attempt to set
        this attribute's value.

        When setting a value of the location attribute which is a regular file
        in the host's file system, the given file name may be either relative to
        the <link to="IVirtualBox::homeFolder">VirtualBox home folder</link> or
        absolute. Note that if the given location specification does not contain
        the file extension part then a proper default extension will be
        automatically appended by the implementation depending on the media type.
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="name" type="wstring" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Name of the storage unit holding media data.

        The returned string is a short version of the <link to="#location"/>
        attribute that is suitable for representing the medium in situations
        where the full location specification is too long (such as lists
        and comboboxes in GUI frontends). This string is also used by frontends
        to sort the media list alphabetically when needed.

        For example, for locations that are regular files in the host's file
        system, the value of this attribute is just a file name (+ extension),
        without the path specification.

        Note that as opposed to the <link to="#location"/> attribute, the name
        attribute will not necessary be unique for a list of media of the
        given type and format.
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="size" type="unsigned long long" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Physical size of the storage unit used to hold media data (in bytes).

        <note>
          For media whose <link to="#state"/> is <link
          to="MediaState_Inaccessible"/>, the value of this property is the
          last known size. For <link to="MediaState_NotCreated"/> media,
          the returned value is zero.
        </note>
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="lastAccessError" type="wstring" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Text message that represents the result of the last accessibility
        check.

        Accessibility checks are performed each time the <link to="#state"/>
        attribute is read. A @c null string is returned if the last
        accessibility check was successful. A non-null string indicates a
        failure and should normally describe a reason of the failure (for
        example, a file read error).
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="machineIds" type="uuid" safearray="yes" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Array of UUIDs of all machines this medium is attached to.

        A <tt>null</tt> array is returned if this medium is not attached to any
        machine or to any machine's snapshot.

        <note>
          The returned array will include a machine even if this medium is not
          attached to that machine in the current state but attached to it in
          one of the machine's snapshots. See <link to="#getSnapshotIds"/> for
          details.
        </note>
      </desc>
    </attribute>

    <method name="getSnapshotIds">
      <desc>
        Returns an array of UUIDs of all snapshots of the given machine where
        this medium is attached to it.

        If the medium is attached to the machine in the current state, then the
        first element in the array will always be the ID of the queried machine
        (i.e. the value equal to the @c machineId argument), followed by
        snapshot IDs (if any).

        If the medium is not attached to the machine in the current state, then
        the array will contain only snapshot IDs.

        The returned array may be <tt>null</tt> if this medium is not attached
        to the given machine at all, neither in the current state nor in one of
        snapshots.
      </desc>
      <param name="machineId" type="uuid" dir="in">

    <method name="lockRead">
      <desc>
        Locks this medium for reading.

        The read lock is shared: many clients can simultaneously lock the
        same media for reading unless it is already locked for writing (see
        <link to="#lockWrite"/>) in which case an error is returned.

        When the medium is locked for reading, it cannot be modified
        from within VirtualBox. This means that any method that changes
        the properties of this medium or contents of the storage unit
        will return an error (unless explicitly stated otherwise) and
        that an attempt to start a virtual machine that wants to modify
        the medium will also fail.

        When the virtual machine is started up, it locks for reading all
        media it uses in read-only mode. If some media cannot be locked
        for reading, the startup procedure will fail.

        The medium locked for reading must be unlocked using the <link
        to="#unlockRead"/> method. Calls to <link to="#lockRead"/>
        can be nested and must be followed by the same number of paired
        <link to="#unlockRead"/> calls.

        This method sets the media state to <link
        to="MediaState_LockedRead"/> on success. The state prior to
        this call must be <link to="MediaState_Created"/>, <link
        to="MediaState_Inaccessible"/> or <link
        to="MediaState_LockedRead"/>. As you can see, inaccessible
        media can be locked too. This is not an error; this method
        performs a logical lock that prevents modifications of this
        media through the VirtualBox API, not a physical lock of the
        underlying storage unit.

        This method returns the current state of the medium
        <b>before</b> the operation.

        <result name="VBOX_E_INVALID_OBJECT_STATE">
          Invalid media state (e.g. not created, locked, inaccessible,
          creating, deleting).

    <method name="lockWrite">
      <desc>
        Locks this medium for writing.

        The write lock, as opposed to <link to="#lockRead"/>, is
        exclusive: there may be only one client that holds a write lock
        and there may be no read locks while the write lock is held.

        When the medium is locked for writing, it cannot be modified
        from within VirtualBox and it is not guaranteed that the values
        of its properties are up-to-date. Any method that changes the
        properties of this medium or contents of the storage unit will
        return an error ((unless explicitly stated otherwise) and an
        attempt to start a virtual machine that wants to modify or to
        read the medium will also fail.

        When the virtual machine is started up, it locks for writing all
        media it uses to write data to. If some media cannot be locked
        for writing, the startup procedure will fail.

        The medium locked for writing must be unlocked using the <link
        to="#unlockWrite"/> method. Calls to <link to="#lockWrite"/>
        can <b>not</b> be nested and must be followed by a paired <link
        to="#unlockWrite"/> call.

        This method sets the media state to <link
        to="MediaState_LockedWrite"/> on success. The state prior to
        this call must be <link to="MediaState_Created"/> or <link
        to="MediaState_Inaccessible"/>. As you can see, inaccessible
        media can be locked too. This is not an error; this method
        performs a logical lock that prevents modifications of this
        media through the VirtualBox API, not a physical lock of the
        underlying storage unit.

        Closes this medium.

        The hard disk must not be attached to any known virtual machine
        and must not have any known child hard disks, otherwise the
        operation will fail.

        When the hard disk is successfully closed, it gets removed from
        the list of remembered hard disks, but its storage unit is not
        deleted. In particular, this means that this hard disk can be
        later opened again using the <link
        to="IVirtualBox::openHardDisk"/> call.

        Note that after this method successfully returns, the given hard
        disk object becomes uninitialized. This means that any attempt
        to call any of its methods or attributes will fail with the

      The IHardDisk interface represents a virtual hard disk drive
      used by a virtual machine. This is a subclass of <link to="IMedium" />; see remarks there.

      Virtual hard disk objects virtualize the hard disk hardware and look like
      regular hard disks for the guest OS running inside the virtual machine.

      <h3>Hard Disk Types</h3>

      There are three types of hard disks:
      <link to="HardDiskType_Normal">Normal</link>,
      <link to="HardDiskType_Immutable">Immutable</link> and
      <link to="HardDiskType_Writethrough">Writethrough</link>. The type of the
      hard disk defines how the hard disk is attached to a virtual machine and
      what happens when a <link to="ISnapshot">snapshot</link> of the virtual
      machine with the attached hard disk is taken. The type of the hard disk is
      defined by the <link to="#type"/> attribute.

      All hard disks can be also divided in two big groups: <i>base</i> hard
      disks and <i>differencing</i> hard disks. A base hard disk contains all
      sectors of the hard disk data in its storage unit and therefore can be
      used independently. On the contrary, a differencing hard disk contains
      only some part of the hard disk data (a subset of sectors) and needs
      another hard disk to get access to the missing sectors of data. This
      another hard disk is called a <i>parent</i> hard disk and defines a hard
      disk to which this differencing hard disk is known to be <i>linked to</i>.
      The parent hard disk may be itself a differencing hard disk. This
      way, differencing hard disks form a linked hard disk chain. This chain
      always ends with the base hard disk which is sometimes referred to as the
      root hard disk of this chain. Note that several differencing hard disks
      may be linked to the same parent hard disk. This way, all known hard disks
      form a hard disk tree which is based on their parent-child relationship.

      Differencing hard disks can be distinguished from base hard disks by
      querying the <link to="#parent"/> attribute: base hard disks do not have
      parents they would depend on, so the value of this attribute is always
      <tt>null</tt> for them. Using this attribute, it is possible to walk up
      the hard disk tree (from the child hard disk to its parent). It is also
      possible to walk down the tree using the <link to="#children"/>
      attribute.

      Note that the type of all differencing hard disks is
      <link to="HardDiskType_Normal">Normal</link>; all other values are
      meaningless for them. Base hard disks may be of any type.

      <h3>Creating Hard Disks</h3>

      New base hard disks are created using
      <link to="IVirtualBox::createHardDisk"/>. Existing hard disks are
      opened using <link to="IVirtualBox::openHardDisk"/>. Differencing hard
      disks are usually implicitly created by VirtualBox when needed but may
      also be created explicitly using <link to="#createDiffStorage"/>.

      After the hard disk is successfully created (including the storage unit)
      or opened, it becomes a known hard disk (remembered in the internal media
      registry). Known hard disks can be attached to a virtual machine, accessed
      through <link to="IVirtualBox::getHardDisk"/> and
      <link to="IVirtualBox::findHardDisk"/> methods or enumerated using the
      <link to="IVirtualBox::hardDisks"/> array (only for base hard disks).

      The following methods, besides <link to="IMedium::close"/>,
      automatically remove the hard disk from the media registry:
      <ul>
        <li><link to="#deleteStorage"/></li>
        <li><link to="#mergeTo"/></li>
      </ul>

      If the storage unit of the hard disk is a regular file in the host's
      file system then the rules stated in the description of the
      <link to="IMedium::location"/> attribute apply when setting its value. In
      addition, a plain file name without any path may be given, in which case
      the <link to="ISystemProperties::defaultHardDiskFolder"> default hard disk
      folder</link> will be prepended to it.

      <h4>Automatic composition of the file name part</h4>

      Another extension to the <link to="IMedium::location"/> attribute is that
      there is a possibility to cause VirtualBox to compose a unique value for
      the file name part of the location using the UUID of the hard disk. This
      applies only to hard disks in <link to="MediaState_NotCreated"/> state,
      e.g. before the storage unit is created, and works as follows. You set the
      value of the <link to="IMedium::location"/> attribute to a location
      specification which only contains the path specification but not the file
      name part and ends with either a forward slash or a backslash character.
      In response, VirtualBox will generate a new UUID for the hard disk and
      compose the file name using the following pattern:
      <pre>
        &lt;path&gt;/{&lt;uuid&gt;}.&lt;ext&gt;
      </pre>
      where <tt>&lt;path&gt;</tt> is the supplied path specification,
      <tt>&lt;uuid&gt;</tt> is the newly generated UUID and <tt>&lt;ext&gt;</tt>
      is the default extension for the storage format of this hard disk. After
      that, you may call any of the methods that create a new hard disk storage
      unit and they will use the generated UUID and file name.

      <h3>Attaching Hard Disks</h3>

      Hard disks are attached to virtual machines using the
      <link to="IMachine::attachHardDisk"/> method and detached using the
      <link to="IMachine::detachHardDisk"/> method. Depending on their
      <link to="#type"/>, hard disks are attached either
      <i>directly</i> or <i>indirectly</i>.

      When a hard disk is being attached directly, it is associated with the
      virtual machine and used for hard disk operations when the machine is
      running. When a hard disk is being attached indirectly, a new differencing
      hard disk linked to it is implicitly created and this differencing hard
      disk is associated with the machine and used for hard disk operations.
      This also means that if <link to="IMachine::attachHardDisk"/> performs
      a direct attachment then the same hard disk will be returned in response
      to the subsequent  <link to="IMachine::getHardDisk"/> call; however if
      an indirect attachment is performed then
      <link to="IMachine::getHardDisk"/> will return the implicitly created
      differencing hard disk, not the original one passed to <link
      to="IMachine::attachHardDisk"/>. The following table shows the
      dependency of the attachment type on the hard disk type:

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Hard Disk Type</th>
          <th>Direct or Indirect?</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Normal (Base)</td>
          <td>
            Normal base hard disks that do not have children (i.e. differencing
            hard disks linked to them) and that are not already attached to
            virtual machines in snapshots are attached <b>directly</b>.
            Otherwise, they are attached <b>indirectly</b> because having
            dependent children or being part of the snapshot makes it impossible
            to modify hard disk contents without breaking the integrity of the
            dependent party. The <link to="#readOnly"/> attribute allows to
            quickly determine the kind of the attachment for the given hard
            disk. Note that if a normal base hard disk is to be indirectly
            attached to a virtual machine with snapshots then a special
            procedure called <i>smart attachment</i> is performed (see below).
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Normal (Differencing)</td>
          <td>
            Differencing hard disks are like normal base hard disks: attached
            <b>directly</b> if they do not have children and are not attached to
            virtual machines in snapshots, and <b>indirectly</b> otherwise. Note
            that the smart attachment procedure is never performed for
            differencing hard disks.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Immutable</td>
          <td>
            Immutable hard disks are always attached <b>indirectly</b> because
            they are designed to be non-writable. If an immutable hard disk is
            attached to a virtual machine with snapshots then a special
            procedure called smart attachment is performed (see below).
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Writethrough</td>
          <td>
            Writethrough hard disks are always attached <b>directly</b>, also as
            designed. This also means that writethrough hard disks cannot have
            other hard disks linked to them at all.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      Note that the same hard disk, regardless of its type, may be attached to
      more than one virtual machine at a time. In this case, the machine that is
      started first gains exclusive access to the hard disk and attempts to
      start other machines having this hard disk attached will fail until the
      first machine is powered down.

      Detaching hard disks is performed in a <i>deferred</i> fashion. This means
      that the given hard disk remains associated with the given machine after a
      successful <link to="IMachine::detachHardDisk"/> call until
      <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> is called to save all changes to
      machine settings to disk. This deferring is necessary to guarantee that
      the hard disk configuration may be restored at any time by a call to
      <link to="IMachine::discardSettings"/>  before the settings
      are saved (committed).

      Note that if <link to="IMachine::discardSettings"/> is called after
      indirectly attaching some hard disks to the machine but before a call to
      <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> is made, it will implicitly delete
      all differencing hard disks implicitly created by
      <link to="IMachine::attachHardDisk"/> for these indirect attachments.
      Such implicitly created hard disks will also be immediately deleted when
      detached explicitly using the <link to="IMachine::detachHardDisk"/>
      call if it is made before <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/>. This
      implicit deletion is safe because newly created differencing hard
      disks do not contain any user data.

      However, keep in mind that detaching differencing hard disks that were
      implicitly created by <link to="IMachine::attachHardDisk"/>
      before the last <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> call will
      <b>not</b> implicitly delete them as they may already contain some data
      (for example, as a result of virtual machine execution). If these hard
      disks are no more necessary, the caller can always delete them explicitly
      using <link to="#deleteStorage"/> after they are actually de-associated
      from this machine by the <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> call.

      <h3>Smart Attachment</h3>

      When normal base or immutable hard disks are indirectly attached to a
      virtual machine then some additional steps are performed to make sure the
      virtual machine will have the most recent "view" of the hard disk being
      attached. These steps include walking through the machine's snapshots
      starting from the current one and going through ancestors up to the first
      snapshot. Hard disks attached to the virtual machine in all
      of the encountered snapshots are checked whether they are descendants of
      the given normal base or immutable hard disk. The first found child (which
      is the differencing hard disk) will be used instead of the normal base or
      immutable hard disk as a parent for creating a new differencing hard disk
      that will be actually attached to the machine. And only if no descendants
      are found or if the virtual machine does not have any snapshots then the
      normal base or immutable hard disk will be used itself as a parent for
      this differencing hard disk.

      It is easier to explain what smart attachment does using the
      following example:
      <pre>
BEFORE attaching B.vdi:       AFTER attaching B.vdi:

Snapshot 1 (B.vdi)            Snapshot 1 (B.vdi)
 Snapshot 2 (D1->B.vdi)        Snapshot 2 (D1->B.vdi)
  Snapshot 3 (D2->D1.vdi)       Snapshot 3 (D2->D1.vdi)
   Snapshot 4 (none)             Snapshot 4 (none)
    CurState   (none)             CurState   (D3->D2.vdi)

                              NOT
                                 ...
                                  CurState   (D3->B.vdi)
      </pre>
      The first column is the virtual machine configuration before the base hard
      disk <tt>B.vdi</tt> is attached, the second column shows the machine after
      this hard disk is attached. Constructs like <tt>D1->B.vdi</tt> and similar
      mean that the hard disk that is actually attached to the machine is a
      differencing hard disk, <tt>D1.vdi</tt>, which is linked to (based on)
      another hard disk, <tt>B.vdi</tt>.

      As we can see from the example, the hard disk <tt>B.vdi</tt> was detached
      from the machine before taking Snapshot 4. Later, after Snapshot 4 was
      taken, the user decides to attach <tt>B.vdi</tt> again. <tt>B.vdi</tt> has
      dependent child hard disks (<tt>D1.vdi</tt>, <tt>D2.vdi</tt>), therefore
      it cannot be attached directly and needs an indirect attachment (i.e.
      implicit creation of a new differencing hard disk). Due to the smart
      attachment procedure, the new differencing hard disk
      (<tt>D3.vdi</tt>) will be based on <tt>D2.vdi</tt>, not on
      <tt>B.vdi</tt> itself, since <tt>D2.vdi</tt> is the most recent view of
      <tt>B.vdi</tt> existing for this snapshot branch of the given virtual
      machine.

      Note that if there is more than one descendant hard disk of the given base
      hard disk found in a snapshot, and there is an exact device, channel and
      bus match, then this exact match will be used. Otherwise, the youngest
      descendant will be picked up.

      There is one more important aspect of the smart attachment procedure which
      is not related to snapshots at all. Before walking through the snapshots
      as described above, the backup copy of the current list of hard disk
      attachment is searched for descendants. This backup copy is created when
      the hard disk configuration is changed for the first time after the last
      <link to="IMachine::saveSettings"/> call and used by
      <link to="IMachine::discardSettings"/> to undo the recent hard disk
      changes. When such a descendant is found in this backup copy, it will be
      simply re-attached back, without creating a new differencing hard disk for
      it. This optimization is necessary to make it possible to re-attach the
      base or immutable hard disk to a different bus, channel or device slot
      without losing the contents of the differencing hard disk actually
      attached to the machine in place of it.

    <attribute name="format" type="wstring" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Storage format of this hard disk.

        The value of this attribute is a string that specifies a backend used to
        store hard disk data. The storage format is defined when you create a
        new hard disk or automatically detected when you open an existing hard
        disk medium, and cannot be changed later.

        The list of all storage formats supported by this VirtualBox
        installation can be obtained using

        The following constraints apply when changing the value of this
        attribute:
        <ul>
          <li>If a hard disk is attached to a virtual machine (either in the
              current state or in one of the snapshots), its type cannot be

          <li>The type of all differencing hard disks is
              <link to="HardDiskType_Normal"/> and cannot be changed.

    <attribute name="root" type="IHardDisk" readonly="yes">
      <desc>
        Root hard disk of this hard disk.

        If this is a differencing hard disk, its root hard disk is the base hard
        disk the given hard disk branch starts from. For all other types of hard
        disks, this property returns the hard disk object itself (i.e. the same

        A hard disk is considered to be read-only when its contents cannot be
        modified without breaking the integrity of other parties that depend on
        this hard disk such as its child hard disks or snapshots of virtual
        machines where this hard disk is attached to these machines. If there
        are no children and no such snapshots then there is no dependency and
        the hard disk is not read-only.

        The value of this attribute can be used to determine the kind of the
        attachment that will take place when attaching this hard disk to a
        virtual machine. If the value is <tt>false</tt> then the hard disk will
        be attached directly. If the value is <tt>true</tt> then the hard disk
        will be attached indirectly by creating a new differencing child hard
        disk for that. See the interface description for more information.

        Note that all <link to="HardDiskType_Immutable">Immutable</link> hard

        existing properties.

        The list of all properties supported by the given hard disk format can
        be obtained with <link to="IHardDiskFormat::describeProperties"/>.

        The method returns two arrays, the array of property names corresponding
        to the @a names argument and the current values of these properties.
        Both arrays have the same number of elements with each elemend at the
        given index in the first array corresponds to an element at the same
        index in the second array.

        Note that for properties that do not have assigned values,
        <tt>null</tt> is returned at the appropriate index in the
        @a returnValues array.

    <method name="setProperties">

        Sets values for a group of properties in one call.

        The names of the properties to set are passed in the @a names
        array along with the new values for them in the @a values array. Both
        arrays have the same number of elements with each elemend at the given
        index in the first array corresponding to an element at the same index
        in the second array.

        If there is at least one property name in @a names that is not valid,
        the method will fail before changing the values of any other properties
        from the @a names array.

        Using this method over <link to="#setProperty"/> is preferred if you
        need to set several properties at once since it will result into less
        IPC calls.

        The list of all properties supported by the given hard disk format can
        be obtained with <link to="IHardDiskFormat::describeProperties"/>.

        Note that setting the property value to <tt>null</tt> is equivalent to
        deleting the existing value. A default value (if it is defined for this
        property) will be used by the format backend in this case.

        The hard disk must not be attached to any known virtual machine and must

        It will also fail if there is no storage unit to delete or if deletion
        is already in progress, or if the hard disk is being in use (locked for

        The target hard disk must be in <link to="MediaState_NotCreated"/>

    <method name="mergeTo">
      <desc>
        Starts merging the contents of this hard disk and all intermediate
        differencing hard disks in the chain to the given target hard disk.

        The target hard disk must be either a descendant of this hard disk or
        its ancestor (otherwise this method will immediately return a failure).
        It follows that there are two logical directions of the merge operation:
        from ancestor to descendant (<i>forward merge</i>) and from descendant to
        ancestor (<i>backward merge</i>). Let us consider the following hard disk
        chain:

        <pre>Base &lt;- Diff_1 &lt;- Diff_2</pre>

        Here, calling this method on the <tt>Base</tt> hard disk object with
        <tt>Diff_2</tt> as an argument will be a forward merge; calling it on
        <tt>Diff_2</tt> with <tt>Base</tt> as an argument will be a backward
        merge. Note that in both cases the contents of the resulting hard disk
        will be the same, the only difference is the hard disk object that takes
        the result of the merge operation. In case of the forward merge in the
        above example, the result will be written to <tt>Diff_2</tt>; in case of
        the backward merge, the result will be written to <tt>Base</tt>. In
        other words, the result of the operation is always stored in the target
        hard disk.

        Upon successful operation completion, the storage units of all hard
        disks in the chain between this (source) hard disk and the target hard
        disk, including the source hard disk itself, will be automatically
        deleted and the relevant hard disk objects (including this hard disk)
        will become uninitialized. This means that any attempt to call any of
        their methods or attributes will fail with the
        <tt>"Object not ready" (E_ACCESSDENIED)</tt> error. Applied to the above
        example, the forward merge of <tt>Base</tt> to <tt>Diff_2</tt> will
        delete and uninitialize both <tt>Base</tt> and <tt>Diff_1</tt> hard
        disks. Note that <tt>Diff_2</tt> in this case will become a base hard
        disk itself since it will no longer be based on any other hard disk.

        Considering the above, all of the following conditions must be met in
        order for the merge operation to succeed:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Neither this (source) hard disk nor any intermediate
            differencing hard disk in the chain between it and the target
            hard disk is attached to any virtual machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Neither the source hard disk nor the target hard disk is an
            <link to="HardDiskType_Immutable"/> hard disk.
          </li>
          <li>
            The part of the hard disk tree from the source hard disk to the
            target hard disk is a linear chain, i.e. all hard disks in this
            chain have exactly one child which is the next hard disk in this
            chain. The only exception from this rule is the target hard disk in
            the forward merge operation; it is allowed to have any number of
            child hard disks because the merge operation will hot change its
            logical contents (as it is seen by the guest OS or by children).
          </li>
          <li>
            None of the involved hard disks are in
            <link to="MediaState_LockedRead"/> or
            <link to="MediaState_LockedWrite"/> state.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <note>
          This (source) hard disk and all intermediates will be placed to <link
          to="MediaState_Deleting"/> state and the target hard disk will be
          placed to <link to="MediaState_LockedWrite"/> state and for the
          duration of this operation.

        The target hard disk must be in <link to="MediaState_NotCreated"/>
        state (i.e. must not have an existing storage unit). Upon successful
        completion, the cloned hard disk will contain exactly the same sector
        data as the hard disk being cloned, except that a new UUID for the clone
        will be randomly generated.

        This operation is similar to <link to="#cloneTo"/> except that when
        applied to a differencing hard disk, it will also copy missing hard disk
        data from all parent hard disks it is linked to. This will make the

        The IHardDiskFormat interface represents a virtual hard disk format.

        Each hard disk format has an associated backend which is used to handle
        hard disks stored in this format. This interface provides information
        about the properties of the associated backend.

        Each hard disk format is identified by a string represented by the
        <link to="#id"/> attribute. This string is used in calls like
        <link to="IVirtualBox::createHardDisk"/> to specify the desired
        format.

        The list of all supported hard disk formats can be obtained using

        this string is case-insensitive. This means that, for example, all of
        the following strings:
        <pre>
          "VDI"
          "vdi"
          "VdI"</pre>
        refer to the same hard disk format.

        This string is used in methods of other interfaces where it is necessary
        to specify a hard disk format, such as
        <link to="IVirtualBox::createHardDisk"/>.

      <desc>
        Requests a size and pixel format change.

        There are two modes of working with the video buffer of the virtual
        machine. The <i>indirect</i> mode implies that the IFramebuffer
        implementation allocates a memory buffer for the requested display mode
        and provides it to the virtual machine. In <i>direct</i> mode, the
        IFramebuffer implementation uses the memory buffer allocated and owned
        by the virtual machine. This buffer represents the video memory of the
        emulated video adapter (so called <i>guest VRAM</i>). The direct mode is
        usually faster because the implementation gets a raw pointer to the
        guest VRAM buffer which it can directly use for visualizing the contents
        of the virtual display, as opposed to the indirect mode where the
        contents of guest VRAM are copied to the memory buffer provided by
        the implementation every time a display update occurs.

        It is important to note that the direct mode is really fast only when
        the implementation uses the given guest VRAM buffer directly, for
        example, by blitting it to the window representing the virtual machine's
        display, which saves at least one copy operation comparing to the
        indirect mode. However, using the guest VRAM buffer directly is not
        always possible: the format and the color depth of this buffer may be
        not supported by the target window, or it may be unknown (opaque) as in
        case of text or non-linear multi-plane VGA video modes. In this case,
        the indirect mode (that is always available) should be used as a
        fallback: when the guest VRAM contents are copied to the
        implementation-provided memory buffer, color and format conversion is
        done automatically by the underlying code.

        The @a pixelFormat parameter defines whether the direct mode is
        available or not. If @a pixelFormat is <link
        to="FramebufferPixelFormat_Opaque"/> then direct access to the guest
        VRAM buffer is not available -- the @a VRAM, @a bitsPerPixel and
        @a bytesPerLine parameters must be ignored and the implementation must use
        the indirect mode (where it provides its own buffer in one of the
        supported formats). In all other cases, @a pixelFormat together with
        @a bitsPerPixel and @a bytesPerLine define the format of the video memory
        buffer pointed to by the @a VRAM parameter and the implementation is
        free to choose which mode to use. To indicate that this frame buffer uses
        the direct mode, the implementation of the <link to="#usesGuestVRAM"/>
        attribute must return <tt>true</tt> and <link to="#address"/> must
        return exactly the same address that is passed in the @a VRAM parameter
        of this method; otherwise it is assumed that the indirect strategy is
        chosen.

        The @a width and @a height parameters represent the size of the
        requested display mode in both modes. In case of indirect mode, the
        provided memory buffer should be big enough to store data of the given
        display mode. In case of direct mode, it is guaranteed that the given
        @a VRAM buffer contains enough space to represent the display mode of the
        given size. Note that this frame buffer's <link to="#width"/> and <link
        to="#height"/> attributes must return exactly the same values as
        passed to this method after the resize is completed (see below).

        The @a finished output parameter determines if the implementation has
        finished resizing the frame buffer or not. If, for some reason, the
        resize cannot be finished immediately during this call, @a finished
        must be set to @c false, and the implementation must call
        <link to="IDisplay::resizeCompleted"/> after it has returned from
        this method as soon as possible. If @a finished is @c false, the
        machine will not call any frame buffer methods until
        <link to="IDisplay::resizeCompleted"/> is called.

        Note that if the direct mode is chosen, the <link to="#bitsPerPixel"/>,
        <link to="#bytesPerLine"/> and <link to="#pixelFormat"/> attributes of
        this frame buffer must return exactly the same values as specified in the
        parameters of this method, after the resize is completed. If the
        indirect mode is chosen, these attributes must return values describing
        the format of the implementation's own memory buffer <link
        to="#address"/> points to. Note also that the <link to="#bitsPerPixel"/>
        value must always correlate with <link to="#pixelFormat"/>. Note that
        the <link to="#pixelFormat"/> attribute must never return <link
        to="FramebufferPixelFormat_Opaque"/> regardless of the selected mode.

        <note>
          This method is called by the IDisplay object under the
          <link to="#lock"/> provided by this IFramebuffer
          implementation. If this method returns @c false in @a finished, then
          this lock is not released until
          <link to="IDisplay::resizeCompleted"/> is called.

      The ISerialPort interface represents the virtual serial port device.

      The virtual serial port device acts like an ordinary serial port
      inside the virtual machine. This device communicates to the real
      serial port hardware in one of two modes: host pipe or host device.

      In host pipe mode, the #path attribute specifies the path to the pipe on
      the host computer that represents a serial port. The #server attribute
      determines if this pipe is created by the virtual machine process at
      machine startup or it must already exist before starting machine
      execution.

      In host device mode, the #path attribute specifies the name of the
      serial port device on the host computer.

      There is also a third communication mode: the disconnected mode. In this
      mode, the guest OS running inside the virtual machine will be able to
      detect the serial port, but all port write operations will be discarded
      and all port read operations will return no data.

      The IUSBDeviceFilter interface represents an USB device filter used
      to perform actions on a group of USB devices.

      This type of filters is used by running virtual machines to
      automatically capture selected USB devices once they are physically
      attached to the host computer.

      A USB device is matched to the given device filter if and only if all
      attributes of the device match the corresponding attributes of the
      filter (that is, attributes are joined together using the logical AND
      operation). On the other hand, all together, filters in the list of
      filters carry the semantics of the logical OR operation. So if it is
      desirable to create a match like "this vendor id OR this product id",
      one needs to create two filters and specify "any match" (see below)
      for unused attributes.

      All filter attributes used for matching are strings. Each string
      is an expression representing a set of values of the corresponding
      device attribute, that will match the given filter. Currently, the
      following filtering expressions are supported:

      <ul>
        <li><i>Interval filters</i>. Used to specify valid intervals for
          integer device attributes (Vendor ID, Product ID and Revision).
          The format of the string is:

          <tt>int:((m)|([m]-[n]))(,(m)|([m]-[n]))*</tt>

          where <tt>m</tt> and <tt>n</tt> are integer numbers, either in octal
          (starting from <tt>0</tt>), hexadecimal (starting from <tt>0x</tt>)
          or decimal (otherwise) form, so that <tt>m &lt; n</tt>. If <tt>m</tt>
          is omitted before a dash (<tt>-</tt>), the minimum possible integer
          is assumed; if <tt>n</tt> is omitted after a dash, the maximum
          possible integer is assumed.
        </li>
        <li><i>Boolean filters</i>. Used to specify acceptable values for
          boolean device attributes. The format of the string is:

          <tt>true|false|yes|no|0|1</tt>

        </li>
        <li><i>Exact match</i>. Used to specify a single value for the given
          device attribute. Any string that doesn't start with <tt>int:</tt>
          represents the exact match. String device attributes are compared to
          this string including case of symbols. Integer attributes are first
          converted to a string (see individual filter attributes) and then
          compared ignoring case.

        </li>
        <li><i>Any match</i>. Any value of the corresponding device attribute
          will match the given filter. An empty or <tt>null</tt> string is
          used to construct this type of filtering expressions.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <note>
        On the Windows host platform, interval filters are not currently
        available. Also all string filter attributes
        (<link to="#manufacturer"/>, <link to="#product"/>,
        <link to="#serialNumber"/>) are ignored, so they behave as
        <i>any match</i> no matter what string expression is specified.

        of the integer part of the revision, and <tt>F</tt> is the
        decimal digit of its fractional part (including leading and
        trailing zeros).
        Note that for interval filters, it's best to use the hexadecimal
        form, because the revision is stored as a 16 bit packed BCD value;
        so the expression <tt>int:0x0100-0x0199</tt> will match any

    <desc>
      USB device state. This enumeration represents all possible states
      of the USB device physically attached to the host computer regarding
      its state on the host computer and availability to guest computers
      (all currently running virtual machines).

      Once a supported USB device is attached to the host, global USB
      filters (<link to="IHost::USBDeviceFilters"/>) are activated. They can
      either ignore the device, or put it to USBDeviceState_Held state, or do
      nothing. Unless the device is ignored by global filters, filters of all
      currently running guests (<link to="IUSBController::deviceFilters"/>) are
      activated that can put it to USBDeviceState_Captured state.

      If the device was ignored by global filters, or didn't match
      any filters at all (including guest ones), it is handled by the host
      in a normal way. In this case, the device state is determined by
      the host and can be one of USBDeviceState_Unavailable, USBDeviceState_Busy
      or USBDeviceState_Available, depending on the current device usage.

      Besides auto-capturing based on filters, the device can be manually
      captured by guests (<link to="IConsole::attachUSBDevice"/>) if its
      state is USBDeviceState_Busy, USBDeviceState_Available or
      USBDeviceState_Held.

      <note>
        Due to differences in USB stack implementations in Linux and Win32,
        states USBDeviceState_Busy and USBDeviceState_vailable are applicable
        only to the Linux version of the product. This also means that (<link
        to="IConsole::attachUSBDevice"/>) can only succeed on Win32 if the
        device state is USBDeviceState_Held.

    <desc>
      The ISharedFolder interface represents a folder in the host computer's
      file system accessible from the guest OS running inside a virtual
      machine using an associated logical name.

      There are three types of shared folders:
      <ul>
        <li><i>Global</i> (<link to="IVirtualBox::sharedFolders"/>), shared
        folders available to all virtual machines.</li>
        <li><i>Permanent</i> (<link to="IMachine::sharedFolders"/>),
        VM-specific shared folders available to the given virtual machine at
        startup.</li>
        <li><i>Transient</i> (<link to="IConsole::sharedFolders"/>),
        VM-specific shared folders created in the session context (for
        example, when the virtual machine is running) and automatically
        discarded when the session is closed (the VM is powered off).</li>
      </ul>

      Logical names of shared folders must be unique within the given scope
      (global, permanent or transient). However, they do not need to be unique
      across scopes. In this case, the definition of the shared folder in a
      more specific scope takes precedence over definitions in all other
      scopes. The order of precedence is (more specific to more general):
      <ol>
        <li>Transient definitions</li>
        <li>Permanent definitions</li>
        <li>Global definitions</li>
      </ol>

      For example, if MyMachine has a shared folder named
      <tt>C_DRIVE</tt> (that points to <tt>C:\\</tt>), then creating a
      transient shared folder named <tt>C_DRIVE</tt> (that points
      to <tt>C:\\\\WINDOWS</tt>) will change the definition
      of <tt>C_DRIVE</tt> in the guest OS so
      that <tt>\\\\VBOXSVR\\C_DRIVE</tt> will give access
      to <tt>C:\\WINDOWS</tt> instead of <tt>C:\\</tt> on the host
      PC. Removing the transient shared folder <tt>C_DRIVE</tt> will restore
      the previous (permanent) definition of <tt>C_DRIVE</tt> that points
      to <tt>C:\\</tt> if it still exists.

      Note that permanent and transient shared folders of different machines
      are in different name spaces, so they don't overlap and don't need to
      have unique logical names.

      <note>
        Global shared folders are not implemented in the current version of the
        product.

     wsmap="managed"
     >
    <desc>
      The ISession interface represents a serialization primitive for virtual
      machines.

      With VirtualBox, every time one wishes to manipulate a virtual machine
      (e.g. change its settings or start execution), a session object is
      required. Such an object must be passed to one of the session methods
      that open the given session, which then initiates the machine manipulation.

      A session serves several purposes: it identifies to the inter-process VirtualBox
      code which process is currently working with the virtual machine, and it ensures
      that there are no incompatible requests from several processes for the
      same virtual machine. Session objects can therefore be thought of as mutex
      semaphores that lock virtual machines to prevent conflicting accesses from
      several processes.

      How sessions objects are used depends on whether you use the Main API
      via COM or via the webservice:

      <ul>
      <li>When using the COM API directly, an object of the Session class from the
      VirtualBox type library needs to be created. In regular COM C++ client code,
      this can be done by calling <tt>createLocalObject()</tt>, a standard COM API.
      This object will  then act as a local session object in further calls to open
      a session.
      </li>

      <li>In the webservice, the session manager (IWebsessionManager) instead creates
      one session object automatically when <link to="IWebsessionManager::logon" />
      is called. A managed object reference to that session object can be retrieved by
      calling <link to="IWebsessionManager::getSessionObject" />. This session object
      reference can then be used to open sessions.
      </li>
      </ul>

      Sessions are mainly used in two variations:

      <ul>
      <li>
      To start a virtual machine in a separate process, one would call
      <link to="IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession"/>, which requires a session
      object as its first parameter. This session then identifies the caller
      and lets him control the started machine (for example, pause machine
      execution or power it down) as well as be notified about machine
      execution state changes.
      </li>

      <li>To alter machine settings, or to start machine execution within the
      current process, one needs to open a direct session for the machine first by
      calling <link to="IVirtualBox::openSession"/>. While a direct session
      is open within one process, no any other process may open another direct
      session for the same machine. This prevents the machine from being changed
      by other processes while it is running or while the machine is being configured.
      </li>
      </ul>

      One also can attach to an existing direct session already opened by
      another process (for example, in order to send a control request to the
      virtual machine such as the pause or the reset request). This is done by
      calling <link to="IVirtualBox::openExistingSession"/>.

      <note>
        Unless you are trying to write a new VirtualBox front-end that
        performs direct machine execution (like the VirtualBox or VBoxSDL
        front-ends), don't call <link to="IConsole::powerUp"/> in a direct
        session opened by <link to="IVirtualBox::openSession"/> and use this
        session only to change virtual machine settings. If you simply want to
        start virtual machine execution using one of the existing front-ends
        (for example the VirtualBox GUI or headless server), simply use
        <link to="IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession"/>; these front-ends
        will power up the machine automatically for you.

    </attribute>

    <method name="close">
      <desc>
        Closes a session that was previously opened.

        It is recommended that every time an "open session" method (such as
        <link to="IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession" /> or
        <link to="IVirtualBox::openSession" />) has been called to
        manipulate a virtual machine, the caller invoke
        ISession::close() when it's done doing so. Since sessions are
        serialization primitives much like ordinary mutexes, they are
        best used the same way: for each "open" call, there should be
        a matching "close" call, even when errors occur.

        Otherwise, if a direct session for a machine opened with
        <link to="IVirtualBox::openSession"/> is not explicitly closed
        when the application terminates, the state of the machine will
        be set to <link to="MachineState_Aborted" /> on the server.

        Generally, it is recommended to close all open sessions explicitly
        before terminating the application (regardless of the reason for
        the termination).

        <note>
          Do not expect the session state (<link to="ISession::state" />
          to return to "Closed" immediately after you invoke
          ISession::close(), particularly if you have started a remote
          session to execute the VM in a new process. The session state will
          automatically return to "Closed" once the VM is no longer executing,
          which can of course take a very long time.

      Managed object reference.

      Only within the webservice, a managed object reference (which is really
      an opaque number) allows a webservice client to address an object
      that lives in the address space of the webservice server.

      Behind each managed object reference, there is a COM object that lives
      in the webservice server's address space. The COM object is not freed
      until the managed object reference is released, either by an explicit
      call to  <link to="IManagedObjectRef::release" /> or by logging off from
      the webservice (<link to="IWebsessionManager::logoff" />), which releases
      all objects created during the webservice session.

      Whenever a method call of the VirtualBox API returns a COM object, the
      webservice representation of that method will instead return a
      managed object reference, which can then be used to invoke methods
      on that object.

      The IPerformanceCollector interface represents a service that collects and
      stores performance metrics data.

      Performance metrics are associated with objects like IHost and
      IMachine. Each object has a distinct set of performance metrics.
      The set can be obtained with <link to="IPerformanceCollector::getMetrics"/>.

      Metric data are collected at the specified intervals and are retained
      internally. The interval and the number of samples retained can be set
      with <link to="IPerformanceCollector::setupMetrics" />.

      Metrics are organized hierarchically, each level separated by slash (/).
      General scheme for metric name is
      "Category/Metric[/SubMetric][:aggregation]". For example CPU/Load/User:avg
      metric name stands for: CPU category, Load metric, User submetric, average
      aggregate. An aggregate function is computed over all retained data. Valid
      aggregate functions are:

      <ul>
      <li>avg -- average</li>
      <li>min -- minimum</li>
      <li>max -- maximum</li>
      </ul>

      "Category/Metric" together form base metric name. A base metric is the
      smallest unit for which a sampling interval and the number of retained
      samples can be set. Only base metrics can be enabled and disabled. All
      sub-metrics are collected when their base metric is collected.
      Collected values for any set of sub-metrics can be queried with
      <link to="IPerformanceCollector::queryMetricsData" />. When setting up
      metric parameters, querying metric data, enabling or disabling metrics
      wildcards can be used in metric names to specify a subset of metrics. For
      example, to select all CPU-related metrics use <tt>CPU/*</tt>, all
      averages can be queried using <tt>*:avg</tt> and so on. To query metric
      values without aggregates <tt>*:</tt> can be used.

      The valid names for base metrics are:

      <ul>
      <li>CPU/Load</li>
      <li>CPU/MHz</li>
      <li>RAM/Usage</li>
      </ul>

      The general sequence for collecting and retrieving the metrics is:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Obtain an instance of IPerformanceCollector with
          <link to="IVirtualBox::performanceCollector" />
        </li>
        <li>
          Allocate and populate an array with references to objects the metrics
          will be collected for. Use references to IHost and IMachine objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allocate and populate an array with base metric names the data will be
          collected for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Call <link to="IPerformanceCollector::setupMetrics" />. From now on the
          metric data will be collected and stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wait for the data to get collected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allocate and populate an array with references to objects the metric
          values will be queried for. You can re-use the object array used for
          setting base metrics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allocate and populate an array with metric names the data will be
          collected for. Note that metric names differ from base metric names.
        </li>
        <li>
          Call <link to="IPerformanceCollector::queryMetricsData" />. The data that
          have been collected so far are returned. Note that the values are still
          retained internally and data collection continues.
        </li>
      </ul>
