Test VM - t-nt310 - Windows NT 3.1 no service pack
====================================================

Setup:
 - Configure a VM t-nt310 with using the Windows NT 3.x settings, but with only
   64 MiB RAM (can't detect more) and 512 MiB disk (2GiB fails NTFS conversion).
 - Edit the storage settings:
        1. Remove ATAPI CDROM.
        2. Add a BusLogic SCSI controller.
        3. Add CDROM to the SCSI controller.
 - Enable COM1.
 - Make sure networking is NAT and PCNET.
 - Enable DNS proxying:
        VBoxManage modifyvm t-nt310 --natdnsproxy1 on.
 - Optionally set 486 as the CPU profile (may avoid install problems):
        VBoxManage modifyvm t-nt310 --cpu-profile "Intel 80486"
 - Install the OS.
        - PCNet are not included on install media, so get them of the
          net and install via floppy when it fails to detect NICs.
        - Use 'password' as Administrator password.
 - Once done rebooting after installation open the network settings and
   add the TCPIP protocol.  Configure it with IP 10.0.2.15, gateway 10.0.2.2,
   and DNS 10.0.2.3 (via "Connections..." button).
 - Reboot and check that you can ping stuff.
 - Add regular user 'test' without a password.
 - Open the system settings and add an environment variable "SystemDrive" with the
   value "C:" (NT 3.50 and later sets this automagically).
 - while in the system settings, reduce the boot wait to 1 second.
 - Insert the ValidationKit ISO and install the test execution service, see
   vboxtxs-readme.txt for details.  Heed the NT 3.x bits.
 - Eject the CD, reboot and test that the TXS works.

Do  N O T  install guest additions!
