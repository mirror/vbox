/**
 * Periodic OA samples are read() into these buffer structures via the
 * i915 perf kernel interface and appended to the
 * brw->perfquery.sample_buffers linked list. When we process the
 * results of an OA metrics query we need to consider all the periodic
 * samples between the Begin and End MI_REPORT_PERF_COUNT command
 * markers.
 *
 * 'Periodic' is a simplification as there are other automatic reports
 * written by the hardware also buffered here.
 *
 * Considering three queries, A, B and C:
 *
 *  Time ---->
 *                ________________A_________________
 *                |                                |
 *                | ________B_________ _____C___________
 *                | |                | |           |   |
 *
 * And an illustration of sample buffers read over this time frame:
 * [HEAD ][     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][TAIL ]
 *
 * These nodes may hold samples for query A:
 * [     ][     ][  A  ][  A  ][  A  ][  A  ][  A  ][     ][     ]
 *
 * These nodes may hold samples for query B:
 * [     ][     ][  B  ][  B  ][  B  ][     ][     ][     ][     ]
 *
 * These nodes may hold samples for query C:
 * [     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][  C  ][  C  ][  C  ][     ]
 *
 * The illustration assumes we have an even distribution of periodic
 * samples so all nodes have the same size plotted against time:
 *
 * Note, to simplify code, the list is never empty.
 *
 * With overlapping queries we can see that periodic OA reports may
 * relate to multiple queries and care needs to be take to keep
 * track of sample buffers until there are no queries that might
 * depend on their contents.
 *
 * We use a node ref counting system where a reference ensures that a
 * node and all following nodes can't be freed/recycled until the
 * reference drops to zero.
 *
 * E.g. with a ref of one here:
 * [  0  ][  0  ][  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
 *
 * These nodes could be freed or recycled ("reaped"):
 * [  0  ][  0  ]
 *
 * These must be preserved until the leading ref drops to zero:
 *               [  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
 *
 * When a query starts we take a reference on the current tail of
 * the list, knowing that no already-buffered samples can possibly
 * relate to the newly-started query. A pointer to this node is
 * also saved in the query object's ->oa.samples_head.
 *
 * E.g. starting query A while there are two nodes in .sample_buffers:
 *                ________________A________
 *                |
 *
 * [  0  ][  1  ]
 *           ^_______ Add a reference and store pointer to node in
 *                    A->oa.samples_head
 *
 * Moving forward to when the B query starts with no new buffer nodes:
 * (for reference, i915 perf reads() are only done when queries finish)
 *                ________________A_______
 *                | ________B___
 *                | |
 *
 * [  0  ][  2  ]
 *           ^_______ Add a reference and store pointer to
 *                    node in B->oa.samples_head
 *
 * Once a query is finished, after an OA query has become 'Ready',
 * once the End OA report has landed and after we we have processed
 * all the intermediate periodic samples then we drop the
 * ->oa.samples_head reference we took at the start.
 *
 * So when the B query has finished we have:
 *                ________________A________
 *                | ______B___________
 *                | |                |
 * [  0  ][  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
 *           ^_______ Drop B->oa.samples_head reference
 *
 * We still can't free these due to the A->oa.samples_head ref:
 *        [  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
 *
 * When the A query finishes: (note there's a new ref for C's samples_head)
 *                ________________A_________________
 *                |                                |
 *                |                    _____C_________
 *                |                    |           |
 * [  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  1  ][  0  ][  0  ]
 *           ^_______ Drop A->oa.samples_head reference
 *
 * And we can now reap these nodes up to the C->oa.samples_head:
 * [  X  ][  X  ][  X  ][  X  ]
 *                  keeping -> [  1  ][  0  ][  0  ]
 *
 * We reap old sample buffers each time we finish processing an OA
 * query by iterating the sample_buffers list from the head until we
 * find a referenced node and stop.
 *
 * Reaped buffers move to a perfquery.free_sample_buffers list and
 * when we come to read() we first look to recycle a buffer from the
 * free_sample_buffers list before allocating a new buffer.

    * The intention of performance queries is to measure the work associated

    * Begin/End counter snapshots with what's running across other parts of the

    * When the command parser reaches a Begin marker it effectively needs to
    * drain everything currently running on the GPU until the hardware is idle
    * before capturing the first snapshot of counters - otherwise the results
    * would also be measuring the effects of earlier commands.
    *
    * When the command parser reaches an End marker it needs to stall until
    * everything currently running on the GPU has finished before capturing the
    * end snapshot - otherwise the results won't be a complete representation
    * of the work.
    *
    * Theoretically there could be opportunities to minimize how much of the
    * GPU pipeline is drained, or that we stall for, when we know what specific
    * units the performance counters being queried relate to but we don't
    * currently attempt to be clever here.
    *
    * Note: with our current simple approach here then for back-to-back queries
    * we will redundantly emit duplicate commands to synchronize the command
    * streamer with the rest of the GPU pipeline, but we assume that in HW the
    * second synchronization is effectively a NOOP.
    *
    * N.B. The final results are based on deltas of counters between (inside)
    * Begin/End markers so even though the total wall clock time of the
    * workload is stretched by larger pipeline bubbles the bubbles themselves
    * are generally invisible to the query results. Whether that's a good or a
