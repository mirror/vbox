/* Design goals:
 *
 *  - Lock free (except when resizing underlying bos)
 *
 *  - Constant time allocation with typically only one atomic
 *
 *  - Multiple allocation sizes without fragmentation
 *
 *  - Can grow while keeping addresses and offset of contents stable
 *
 *  - All allocations within one bo so we can point one of the
 *    STATE_BASE_ADDRESS pointers at it.
 *
 * The overall design is a two-level allocator: top level is a fixed size, big
 * block (8k) allocator, which operates out of a bo.  Allocation is done by
 * either pulling a block from the free list or growing the used range of the
 * bo.  Growing the range may run out of space in the bo which we then need to
 * grow.  Growing the bo is tricky in a multi-threaded, lockless environment:
 * we need to keep all pointers and contents in the old map valid.  GEM bos in
 * general can't grow, but we use a trick: we create a memfd and use ftruncate
 * to grow it as necessary.  We mmap the new size and then create a gem bo for
 * it using the new gem userptr ioctl.  Without heavy-handed locking around
 * our allocation fast-path, there isn't really a way to munmap the old mmap,
 * so we just keep it around until garbage collection time.  While the block
 * allocator is lockless for normal operations, we block other threads trying
 * to allocate while we're growing the map.  It sholdn't happen often, and
 * growing is fast anyway.
 *
 * At the next level we can use various sub-allocators.  The state pool is a
 * pool of smaller, fixed size objects, which operates much like the block
 * pool.  It uses a free list for freeing objects, but when it runs out of
 * space it just allocates a new block from the block pool.  This allocator is
 * intended for longer lived state objects such as SURFACE_STATE and most
 * other persistent state objects in the API.  We may need to track more info
 * with these object and a pointer back to the CPU object (eg VkImage).  In
 * those cases we just allocate a slightly bigger object and put the extra
 * state after the GPU state object.
 *
 * The state stream allocator works similar to how the i965 DRI driver streams
 * all its state.  Even with Vulkan, we need to emit transient state (whether
 * surface state base or dynamic state base), and for that we can just get a
 * block and fill it up.  These cases are local to a command buffer and the
 * sub-allocator need not be thread safe.  The streaming allocator gets a new
 * block when it runs out of space and chains them together so they can be
 * easily freed.
 */

/* Allocations are always at least 64 byte aligned, so 1 is an invalid value.
 * We use it to indicate the free list is empty. */

          *       state could potentially split a 2MB chunk into 512K smaller
          *       chunks.  This would lead to unnecessary fragmentation.
          *
          *    2) The classic "buddy allocator" method would have us split the
          *       chunk in half and return one half.  Then we would split the
          *       remaining half in half and return one half, and repeat as
          *       needed until we get down to the size we want.  However, if
          *       you are allocating a bunch of the same size state (which is
          *       the common case), this means that every other allocation has
          *       to go up a level and every fourth goes up two levels, etc.
          *       This is not nearly as efficient as it could be if we did a
          *       little more work up-front.
          *
          *    3) Split the difference between (1) and (2) by doing a
          *       two-level split.  If it's bigger than some fixed block_size,
          *       we split it into block_size sized chunks and return all but
          *       one of them.  Then we split what remains into
          *       state.alloc_size sized chunks and return all but one.
