Release change log structure

Each release has a matching log of changes which were made for that and
earlier releases. Earlier releases means anything with a lower number (e.g.
5.0.18 is lower than 5.1.2) which was released before this one. The log is
kept in the file doc/manual/user_ChangeLogImpl.xml. Anything worth mentioning,
particularly new features and fixed bugs, with a trac bug number if possible,
should be added to the top of the change log (that is, the section for the
upcoming release) for the branch in which it first appears - stable or
development - before the next release. If you back-port it to older branches
please add an entry there too. When a new major release is made, change log
sections for earlier releases are merged in.

Change log sections are split into two groups: major new features (normally
only for dot zero releases) and fixes. In addition, the entries in each group
are ordered as follows:

    VMM-related entries (most important)
    GUI-related entries (most visible for users)
    Device-related entries
    VBoxManage/API/Main-related entries
    Host-related entries
    Guest-related entries
    BIOS/EFI/ACPI-related entries

Please do further ordering as seems appropriate by importance and visibility for
users, e.g. audio before serial ports and generally Windows before Linux.  Please
also try to describe the user impact, not the technical details, and only use
technical terms if no non-technical ones are clear enough.

Rules for adding a changelog entry to make them look more uniform:

    1. Begin the entry with an UPPERCASE letter, e.g. "Foo: Fixed" vs. "Foo: fixed"
    2. Use the past form of something, e.g. "Fixed ..." vs. "Fix ..."
    3. No dot (.) after the entry, e.g. "<para>Foo: Bar</para>" vs. "<para>Foo: Bar.</para>"
    4. Use TWO (2) spaces for indentation
    5. Use line breaks when hitting column 80

    Full example:

        <listitem>
          <para>Foo: Fixed something really important, really really long line
            with lots more text not fitting into 80 columns</para>
        </listitem>

<!-- HACK ALERT! Seems we must have a single top level element for xi:include to work.
                           So, we use chapter and xpointer="xpointer(/chapter/)" with xi:include. -->
