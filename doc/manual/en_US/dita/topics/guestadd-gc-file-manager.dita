  <title>Guest Control File Manager</title>

    <p>
      The Guest Control File Manager is a feature of the Guest Additions
      that enables easy copying and moving of files between a guest and
      the host system. Other file management operations provide support
      to create new folders and to rename or delete files.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature is useful when the VM window of a guest is not
      visible. For example, when the guest is running in headless mode.

      <p>
        To use the Guest Control File Manager, the guest must be
        running. For powered-off guests, it is disabled automatically.

    <p>
      The Guest Control File Manager works by mounting the host file
      system. Guest users must authenticate and create a guest session
      before they can transfer files.
