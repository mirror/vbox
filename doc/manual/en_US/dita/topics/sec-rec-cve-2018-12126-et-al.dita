        These security issues affect a range of Intel CPUs starting with
        Nehalem. The CVE-2018-12130 also affects some Atom Silvermont,
        Atom Airmont, and Knights family CPUs, however the scope is so
        limited that the host OS should deal with it and <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>
        is therefore not affected. Leaks only happens when entering and
        leaving C states.
