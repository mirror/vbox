      <para>The following <emphasis role="bold">Guest SMP (multiprocessor)

            solved in 3.0.6 for 32 bits Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003 guests.

            32-bit guests on certain Intel CPU models that do not include
            virtual APIC hardware optimization support. This affects mainly
            Windows and Solaris guests, but possibly also some Linux kernel
            revisions. Partially solved in 3.0.12 for 32 bits Windows NT,
            2000, XP and 2003 guests. Requires 3.0.12 or higher Guest

      <para><emphasis role="bold">64-bit guests on some 32-bit host systems
      with VT-x</emphasis> can cause instabilities to your system. If you
      experience this, do not attempt to execute 64-bit guests. Refer to the
      VirtualBox user forum for additional information.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>For <emphasis role="bold">basic Direct3D support in Windows
      guests</emphasis> to work, the Guest Additions must be installed in
      Windows "safe mode". Press F8 when the Windows guest is booting and
      select "Safe mode", then install the Guest Additions. Otherwise Windows'
      file protection mechanism will interfere with the replacement DLLs
      installed by VirtualBox and keep restoring the original Windows system
      DLLs. <note>
      <para>This does <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> apply to the
      experimental WDDM Direct3D video

      desktop session.</para>

      <para>Also, to use accounts without or with an empty password, the
      guest's group policy must be changed. To do so, open the group policy
      editor on the command line by typing
      <computeroutput>gpedit.msc</computeroutput>, open the key
      <emphasis>Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security
      Settings\Local Policies\Security Options</emphasis> and change the value

      VDI files.</emphasis> The <code>VBoxManage modifyhd --compact</code>
      command is currently only implemented for VDI files. At the moment the
      only way to optimize the size of a virtual disk images in other formats
      (VMDK, VHD) is to clone the image and then use the cloned image in the

          <listitem>
            <para>Depending on your system and version of Mac OS X Server, you
            might experience guest hangs after some time. This can be fixed by

            <para>By default, the VirtualBox EFI enables debug output of the
            Mac OS X Server kernel to help you diagnose boot problems. Note
            that there is a lot of output and not all errors are fatal (they
            would also show on your physical Mac). You can turn off these
            messages by issuing this command:<screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" "  "</screen>To
            revert to the previous behavior, use:<screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" ""</screen></para>

          <listitem>
            <para>USB support on Solaris hosts requires Solaris 11 version

          <listitem>
            <para>Crossbow based bridged networking on Solaris 11 hosts does
            not work directly with aggregate links. However, you can manually
            create a VNIC (using <computeroutput>dladm</computeroutput>) over
            the aggregate link and use that with a VM. This technical
            limitation between VirtualBox and Solaris will be addressed in a

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Guest Additions for OS/2.</emphasis> Shared
      folders are not yet supported with OS/2 guests. In addition, seamless
      windows and automatic guest resizing will probably never be implemented
      due to inherent limitations of the OS/2 graphics system.</para>
