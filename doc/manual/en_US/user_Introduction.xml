  <para>
    Welcome to &product-name;.
  </para>

  <para>
    &product-name; is a cross-platform virtualization application. What
    does that mean? For one thing, it installs on your existing Intel or
    AMD-based computers, whether they are running Windows, Mac OS X,
    Linux, or Oracle Solaris operating systems (OSes). Secondly, it
    extends the capabilities of your existing computer so that it can
    run multiple OSes, inside multiple virtual machines, at the same
    time. As an example, you can run Windows and Linux on your Mac, run
    Windows Server 2016 on your Linux server, run Linux on your Windows
    PC, and so on, all alongside your existing applications. You can
    install and run as many virtual machines as you like. The only
    practical limits are disk space and memory.
  </para>

  <para>
    &product-name; is deceptively simple yet also very powerful. It can
    run everywhere from small embedded systems or desktop class machines
    all the way up to datacenter deployments and even Cloud
    environments.
  </para>

  <para>
    The following screenshot shows how &product-name;, installed on an
    Apple Mac OS X computer, is running Windows Server 2016 in a virtual
    machine window.

    In this User Manual, we will begin simply with a quick introduction
    to virtualization and how to get your first virtual machine running
    with the easy-to-use &product-name; graphical user interface.
    Subsequent chapters will go into much more detail covering more
    powerful tools and features, but fortunately, it is not necessary to
    read the entire User Manual before you can use &product-name;.

    <title>Why is Virtualization Useful?</title>

    <para>
      The techniques and features that &product-name; provides are
      useful in the following scenarios:

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Running multiple operating systems
          simultaneously.</emphasis> &product-name; enables you to run
          more than one OS at a time. This way, you can run software
          written for one OS on another, such as Windows software on
          Linux or a Mac, without having to reboot to use it. Since you
          can configure what kinds of <emphasis>virtual</emphasis>
          hardware should be presented to each such OS, you can install
          an old OS such as DOS or OS/2 even if your real computer's
          hardware is no longer supported by that OS.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Easier software
          installations.</emphasis> Software vendors can use virtual
          machines to ship entire software configurations. For example,
          installing a complete mail server solution on a real machine
          can be a tedious task. With &product-name;, such a complex
          setup, often called an <emphasis>appliance</emphasis>, can be
          packed into a virtual machine. Installing and running a mail
          server becomes as easy as importing such an appliance into
          &product-name;.

          <emphasis role="bold">Testing and disaster
          recovery.</emphasis> Once installed, a virtual machine and its

          woken up, copied, backed up, and transported between hosts.
        </para>

        <para>
          On top of that, with the use of another &product-name; feature
          called <emphasis>snapshots</emphasis>, one can save a
          particular state of a virtual machine and revert back to that
          state, if necessary. This way, one can freely experiment with
          a computing environment. If something goes wrong, such as
          prolems after installing software or infecting the guest with
          a virus, you can easily switch back to a previous snapshot and
          avoid the need of frequent backups and restores.
        </para>

        <para>
          Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel
          back and forward in virtual machine time. You can delete
          snapshots while a VM is running to reclaim disk space.

          Virtualization can significantly reduce hardware and
          electricity costs. Most of the time, computers today only use
          a fraction of their potential power and run with low average
          system loads. A lot of hardware resources as well as
          electricity is thereby wasted. So, instead of running many
          such physical computers that are only partially used, one can
          pack many virtual machines onto a few powerful hosts and
          balance the loads between them.

    <title>Some Terminology</title>

    <para>
      When dealing with virtualization, and also for understanding the
      following chapters of this documentation, it helps to acquaint
      oneself with a bit of crucial terminology, especially the
      following terms:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Host operating system (host
          OS).</emphasis> This is the OS of the physical computer on
          which &product-name; was installed. There are versions of
          &product-name; for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Oracle
          Solaris hosts. See <xref linkend="hostossupport" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          Most of the time, this manual discusses all &product-name;
          versions together. There may be platform-specific differences
          which we will point out where appropriate.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Guest operating system (guest
          OS).</emphasis> This is the OS that is running inside the
          virtual machine. Theoretically, &product-name; can run any x86
          OS. such as DOS, Windows, OS/2, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. But to
          achieve near-native performance of the guest code on your
          machine, we had to go through a lot of optimizations that are
          specific to certain OSes. So while your favorite OS
          <emphasis>may</emphasis> run as a guest, we officially support
          and optimize for a select few, which include the most common
          OSes.
        </para>

        <para>
          See <xref linkend="guestossupport" />.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Virtual machine (VM).</emphasis> This
          is the special environment that &product-name; creates for
          your guest OS while it is running. In other words, you run
          your guest OS <emphasis>in</emphasis> a VM. Normally, a VM
          will be shown as a window on your computer's desktop, but
          depending on which of the various frontends of &product-name;
          you use, it can be displayed in full screen mode or remotely
          on another computer.
        </para>

        <para>
          In a more abstract way, internally, &product-name; thinks of a
          VM as a set of parameters that determine its behavior. They
          include hardware settings, such as: how much memory the VM
          should have, what hard disks &product-name; should virtualize
          through which container files, what CDs are mounted. They also
          include state information, such as: whether the VM is
          currently running, saved, if the VM has snapshots. These
          settings are mirrored in the VirtualBox Manager window, as
          well as the <command>VBoxManage</command> command. See
          <xref linkend="vboxmanage" />. In other words, a VM is also
          what you can see in its
          <emphasis role="bold">Settings</emphasis> dialog.

          <emphasis role="strong">Guest Additions.</emphasis> This
          refers to special software packages which are shipped with
          &product-name; but designed to be installed
          <emphasis>inside</emphasis> a VM to improve performance of the
          guest OS and to add extra features. See

    <title>Features Overview</title>

    <para>
      The following is a brief outline of &product-name;'s main
      features:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Portability.</emphasis> &product-name;
          runs on a large number of 32-bit and 64-bit host OS. See
          <xref
          linkend="hostossupport" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          &product-name; is a so-called <emphasis>hosted</emphasis>
          hypervisor, sometimes referred to as a <emphasis>type
          2</emphasis> hypervisor. Whereas a
          <emphasis>bare-metal</emphasis> or <emphasis>type 1</emphasis>
          hypervisor would run directly on the hardware, &product-name;
          requires an existing OS to be installed. It can thus run
          alongside existing applications on that host.
        </para>

        <para>
          To a very large degree, &product-name; is functionally
          identical on all of the host platforms, and the same file and
          image formats are used. This enables you to run virtual
          machines created on one host on another host with a different
          host OS. For example, you can create a virtual machine on
          Windows and then run it under Linux.
        </para>

        <para>
          In addition, virtual machines can easily be imported and
          exported using the Open Virtualization Format (OVF), an
          industry standard created for this purpose. You can even
          import OVFs that were created with a different virtualization
          software. See <xref linkend="ovf" />.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">No hardware virtualization
          required.</emphasis> For many scenarios, &product-name; does
          not require the processor features built into newer hardware
          like Intel VT-x or AMD-V. As opposed to many other
          virtualization solutions, you can therefore use &product-name;
          even on older hardware where these features are not present.
          See <xref
        linkend="hwvirt" />.

          <emphasis role="bold">Guest Additions: shared folders,
          seamless windows, 3D virtualization.</emphasis> The
          &product-name; Guest Additions are software packages which can
          be installed <emphasis>inside</emphasis> of supported guest
          systems to improve their performance and to provide additional
          integration and communication with the host system. After
          installing the Guest Additions, a virtual machine will support
          automatic adjustment of video resolutions, seamless windows,
          accelerated 3D graphics and more. See
          <xref linkend="guestadditions" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          In particular, Guest Additions provide for "shared folders",
          which let you access files from the host system from within a
          guest machine. See <xref linkend="sharedfolders" />.

              virtual machines without having to install device-specific
              drivers on the host. USB support is not limited to certain
              device categories. See <xref linkend="settings-usb" />.

              &product-name; virtualizes a vast array of virtual
              devices, among them many devices that are typically
              provided by other virtualization platforms. That includes
              IDE, SCSI and SATA hard disk controllers, several virtual
              network cards and sound cards, virtual serial and parallel
              ports and an Input/Output Advanced Programmable Interrupt
              Controller (I/O APIC), which is found in many modern PC
              systems. This eases cloning of PC images from real
              machines and importing of third-party virtual machines
              into &product-name;.

              machine directly to an iSCSI storage server without going
              through the host system. The VM accesses the iSCSI target
              directly without the extra overhead that is required for

          in time and revert the virtual machine to any such snapshot
          and start an alternative VM configuration from there,
          effectively creating a whole snapshot tree. See

          provides a groups feature that enables the user to organize
          and control virtual machines collectively, as well as
          individually. In addition to basic groups, it is also possible
          for any VM to be in more than one group, and for groups to be
          nested in a hierarchy. This means you can have groups of
          groups. In general, the operations that can be performed on
          groups are the same as those that can be applied to individual
          VMs: Start, Pause, Reset, Close (Save state, Send Shutdown,

          <emphasis role="bold">Clean architecture and unprecedented
          modularity.</emphasis> &product-name; has an extremely modular
          design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a
          clean separation of client and server code. This makes it easy
          to control it from several interfaces at once. For example,
          you can start a VM simply by clicking on a button in the
          &product-name; graphical user interface and then control that
          machine from the command line, or even remotely. See
          <xref linkend="frontends" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          Due to its modular architecture, &product-name; can also
          expose its full functionality and configurability through a
          comprehensive <emphasis role="bold">software development kit

          <emphasis role="bold">Remote machine display.</emphasis> The
          VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension (VRDE) enables
          high-performance remote access to any running virtual machine.
          This extension supports the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
          originally built into Microsoft Windows, with special
          additions for full client USB support.
        </para>

        <para>
          The VRDE does not rely on the RDP server that is built into
          Microsoft Windows. Instead, the VRDE is plugged directly into
          the virtualization layer. As a result, it works with guest
          OSes other than Windows, even in text mode, and does not
          require application support in the virtual machine either. The
          VRDE is described in detail in <xref linkend="vrde" />.

        </para>

        <caution>
          <para>
            Choose this setting carefully. The memory you give to the VM
            will not be available to your host OS while the VM is
            running, so do not specify more than you can spare. For
            example, if your host machine has 1 GB of RAM and you enter
            512 MB as the amount of RAM for a particular virtual
            machine, while that VM is running, you will only have 512 MB
            left for all the other software on your host. If you run two
            VMs at the same time, even more memory will be allocated for
            the second VM, which may not even be able to start if that
            memory is not available. On the other hand, you should
            specify as much as your guest OS and your applications will
            require to run properly.

        <para>
          A Windows XP guest will require at least a few hundred MB of
          RAM to run properly, and Windows Vista will not install with
          less than 512 MB. If you want to run graphics-intensive
          applications in your VM, you may require even more RAM.
        </para>

        <para>
          As a rule of thumb, if you have 1 GB of RAM or more in your
          host computer, it is usually safe to allocate 512 MB to each
          VM. In any case, make sure you always have at least 256 to 512
          MB of RAM left on your host OS. Otherwise you may cause your
          host OS to excessively swap out memory to your hard disk,
          effectively bringing your host system to a standstill.

          There are many and potentially complicated ways in which
          &product-name; can provide hard disk space to a VM, see

          a large image file on your "real" hard disk, whose contents
          &product-name; presents to your VM as if it were a complete
          hard disk. This file represents an entire hard disk then, so

        Otherwise, if the virtual machine only sees standard PS/2 mouse

        not know that it is not running on a real computer, it expects
        to have exclusive control over your keyboard and mouse. But

        After installing a guest OS and before you install the Guest

          <para>
            Your <emphasis role="bold">keyboard</emphasis> is owned by
            the VM if the VM window on your host desktop has the
            keyboard focus. If you have many windows open in your guest
            OS, the window that has the focus in your VM is used. This
            means that if you want to enter text within your VM, click
            on the title bar of your VM window first.
          </para>

          <para>
            To release keyboard ownership, press the Host key. As
            explained above, this is typically the right Ctrl key.
          </para>

          <para>
            Note that while the VM owns the keyboard, some key
            sequences, such as Alt-Tab, will no longer be seen by the
            host, but will go to the guest instead. After you press the
            Host key to reenable the host keyboard, all key presses will
            go through the host again, so that sequences such as Alt-Tab
            will no longer reach the guest. For technical reasons it may
            not be possible for the VM to get all keyboard input even
            when it does own the keyboard. Examples of this are the
            Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence on Windows hosts or single keys
            grabbed by other applications on X11 hosts like the GNOME

            necessarily owned by the VM yet.

            Host OSes reserve certain key combinations for themselves.
            For example, it is impossible to enter the

            if you want to reboot the guest OS in your virtual machine,
            because this key combination is usually hard-wired into the
            host OS, both Windows and Linux intercept this, and pressing
            this key combination will therefore reboot your

          <para>
            On Linux and Oracle Solaris hosts, which use the X Window

            <emphasis role="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Backspace</emphasis> normally
            resets the X server and restarts the entire graphical user
            interface. As the X server intercepts this combination,
            pressing it will usually restart your

            When you start the VM again later, you will find that the VM
            continues exactly where it was left off. All your programs

            Saving the state of a virtual machine is thus in some ways
            similar to suspending a laptop computer by closing its lid.

            running a fairly modern OS, this should trigger a proper

              This is equivalent to pulling the power plug on a real

              to reboot completely and may begin a lengthy check of its
              virtual system disks. As a result, this should not
              normally be done, since it can potentially cause data loss
              or an inconsistent state of the guest system on disk.

              Restoring a snapshot will affect the virtual hard drives
              that are connected to your VM, as the entire state of the
              virtual hard drive will be reverted as well. This means
              also that all files that have been created since the
              snapshot and all other file changes <emphasis>will be
              lost. </emphasis>In order to prevent such data loss while

            By restoring an earlier snapshot and taking more snapshots

              Whereas taking and restoring snapshots are fairly quick

      <title>Snapshot Contents</title>

      <para>
        Think of a snapshot as a point in time that you have preserved.
        More formally, a snapshot consists of the following:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            The snapshot contains a complete copy of the VM settings,
            including the hardware configuration, so that when you
            restore a snapshot, the VM settings are restored as well.
            For example, if you changed the hard disk configuration or
            the VM's system settings, that change is undone when you
            restore the snapshot.
          </para>

          <para>
            The copy of the settings is stored in the machine
            configuration, an XML text file, and thus occupies very
            little space.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            The complete state of all the virtual disks attached to the
            machine is preserved. Going back to a snapshot means that
            all changes that had been made to the machine's disks, file
            by file and bit by bit, will be undone as well. Files that
            were since created will disappear, files that were deleted
            will be restored, changes to files will be reverted.
          </para>

          <para>
            Strictly speaking, this is only true for virtual hard disks
            in "normal" mode. You can configure disks to behave
            differently with snapshots, see
            <xref linkend="hdimagewrites" />. In technical terms, it is
            not the virtual disk itself that is restored when a snapshot
            is restored. Instead, when a snapshot is taken,
            &product-name; creates differencing images which contain
            only the changes since the snapshot were taken. When the
            snapshot is restored, &product-name; throws away that
            differencing image, thus going back to the previous state.
            This is both faster and uses less disk space. For the
            details, which can be complex, see
            <xref linkend="diffimages" />.
          </para>

          <para>
            Creating the differencing image as such does not occupy much
            space on the host disk initially, since the differencing
            image will initially be empty and grow dynamically later
            with each write operation to the disk. The longer you use
            the machine after having created the snapshot, however, the
            more the differencing image will grow in size.

          <para>
            If you took a snapshot while the machine was running, the
            memory state of the machine is also saved in the snapshot.
            This is in the same way that memory can be saved when you
            close a VM window. When you restore such a snapshot,
            execution resumes at exactly the point when the snapshot was
            taken.
          </para>

          <para>
            The memory state file can be as large as the memory size of
            the virtual machine and will therefore occupy quite some

    <title>Alternative Front-Ends</title>

    <para>
      As briefly mentioned in <xref linkend="features-overview" />,
      &product-name; has a very flexible internal design that enables
      you to use multiple interfaces to control the same virtual
      machines. For example, you can start a virtual machine with the
      VirtualBox Manager window and then stop it from the command line.
      With &product-name;'s support for the Remote Desktop Protocol
      (RDP), you can even run virtual machines remotely on a headless
      server and have all the graphical output redirected over the
      network.
    </para>

          <emphasis role="bold">VirtualBox.</emphasis> This is the
          VirtualBox Manager, a graphical user interface that uses the
          Qt toolkit. This interface is described throughout this
          manual. While this is the simplest and easiest front-end to
          use, some of the more advanced &product-name; features are not
          included.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">VBoxManage.</emphasis> A command-line
          interface for automated and detailed control of every aspect
          of &product-name;. See
          <xref
          linkend="vboxmanage" />.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">VBoxHeadless.</emphasis> A front-end
          that produces no visible output on the host at all, but can
          act as a RDP server if the VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension
          (VRDE) is installed and enabled for the VM. As opposed to the
          other graphical interfaces, the headless front-end requires no
          graphics support. This is useful, for example, if you want to
          host your virtual machines on a headless Linux server that has
          no X Window system installed. See
          <xref linkend="vboxheadless" />.

      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      If the above front-ends still do not satisfy your particular
      needs, it is possible to create yet another front-end to the
      complex virtualization engine that is the core of &product-name;,
      as the &product-name; core neatly exposes all of its features in a
      clean API. See <xref linkend="VirtualBoxAPI" />.
