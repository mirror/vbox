  <title>Guest Additions</title>

  <para>
    The previous chapter covered getting started with VirtualBox and
    installing operating systems in a virtual machine. For any serious
    and interactive use, the VirtualBox Guest Additions will make your
    life much easier by providing closer integration between host and
    guest and improving the interactive performance of guest systems.
    This chapter describes the Guest Additions in detail.

    <title>Introduction to Guest Additions</title>

    <para>
      As mentioned in <xref linkend="virtintro" />, the Guest Additions
      are designed to be installed <emphasis>inside</emphasis> a virtual
      machine after the guest operating system has been installed. They
      consist of device drivers and system applications that optimize
      the guest operating system for better performance and usability.
      See <xref
    linkend="guestossupport" /> for details on what
      guest operating systems are fully supported with Guest Additions
      by VirtualBox.
    </para>

    <para>
      The VirtualBox Guest Additions for all supported guest operating
      systems are provided as a single CD-ROM image file which is called
      <computeroutput>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</computeroutput>. This
      image file is located in the installation directory of VirtualBox.
      To install the Guest Additions for a particular VM, you mount this
      ISO file in your VM as a virtual CD-ROM and install from there.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Guest Additions offer the following features:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Mouse pointer integration</emphasis>. To
          overcome the limitations for mouse support described in
          <xref linkend="keyb_mouse_normal" />, this feature provides
          you with seamless mouse support. You will only have one mouse
          pointer and pressing the Host key is no longer required to
          "free" the mouse from being captured by the guest OS. To make
          this work, a special mouse driver is installed in the guest
          that communicates with the "real" mouse driver on your host
          and moves the guest mouse pointer accordingly.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Shared folders.</emphasis> These provide
          an easy way to exchange files between the host and the guest.
          Much like ordinary Windows network shares, you can tell
          VirtualBox to treat a certain host directory as a shared
          folder, and VirtualBox will make it available to the guest
          operating system as a network share, irrespective of whether
          guest actually has a network. See
          <xref
            linkend="sharedfolders" />.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Better video support.</emphasis> While
          the virtual graphics card which VirtualBox emulates for any
          guest operating system provides all the basic features, the
          custom video drivers that are installed with the Guest
          Additions provide you with extra high and non-standard video
          modes, as well as accelerated video performance.
        </para>

        <para>
          In addition, with Windows, Linux, and Solaris guests, you can
          resize the virtual machine's window if the Guest Additions are
          installed. The video resolution in the guest will be
          automatically adjusted, as if you had manually entered an
          arbitrary resolution in the guest's display settings. See
          <xref
            linkend="intro-resize-window" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          If the Guest Additions are installed, 3D graphics and 2D video
          for guest applications can be accelerated. See
          <xref
            linkend="guestadd-video" />.

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Seamless windows.</emphasis> With this
          feature, the individual windows that are displayed on the
          desktop of the virtual machine can be mapped on the host's
          desktop, as if the underlying application was actually running
          on the host. See <xref linkend="seamlesswindows" />.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Generic host/guest communication
          channels.</emphasis> The Guest Additions enable you to control
          and monitor guest execution. The "guest properties" provide a
          generic string-based mechanism to exchange data bits between a
          guest and a host, some of which have special meanings for
          controlling and monitoring the guest. See
          <xref linkend="guestadd-guestprops" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          Additionally, applications can be started in a guest from the
          host. See <xref linkend="guestadd-guestcontrol" />.

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Time synchronization.</emphasis> With
          the Guest Additions installed, VirtualBox can ensure that the
          guest's system time is better synchronized with that of the
          host.
        </para>

        <para>
          For various reasons, the time in the guest might run at a
          slightly different rate than the time on the host. The host
          could be receiving updates via NTP and its own time might not
          run linearly. A VM could also be paused, which stops the flow
          of time in the guest for a shorter or longer period of time.
          When the wall clock time between the guest and host only
          differs slightly, the time synchronization service attempts to
          gradually and smoothly adjust the guest time in small
          increments to either "catch up" or "lose" time. When the
          difference is too great, for example if a VM paused for hours
          or restored from saved state, the guest time is changed
          immediately, without a gradual adjustment.
        </para>

        <para>
          The Guest Additions will resynchronize the time regularly. See
          <xref linkend="changetimesync" /> for how to configure the
          parameters of the time synchronization mechanism.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Shared clipboard.</emphasis> With the
          Guest Additions installed, the clipboard of the guest
          operating system can optionally be shared with your host
          operating system. See <xref linkend="generalsettings" />.

        </para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      Each version of VirtualBox, even minor releases, ship with their
      own version of the Guest Additions. While the interfaces through
      which the VirtualBox core communicates with the Guest Additions
      are kept stable so that Guest Additions already installed in a VM
      should continue to work when VirtualBox is upgraded on the host,
      for best results, it is recommended to keep the Guest Additions at
      the same version.
    </para>

    <para>
      Starting with VirtualBox 3.1, the Windows and Linux Guest
      Additions therefore check automatically whether they have to be
      updated. If the host is running a newer VirtualBox version than
      the Guest Additions, a notification with further instructions is
      displayed in the guest.
    </para>

    <para>
      To disable this update check for the Guest Additions of a given
      virtual machine, set the value of its
      <computeroutput>/VirtualBox/GuestAdd/CheckHostVersion</computeroutput>
      guest property to <computeroutput>0</computeroutput>. See

        Note that some Linux distributions already come with all or part

        often not up to date and limited in functionality, so we
        recommend replacing them with the Guest Additions that come with
        VirtualBox. The VirtualBox Linux Guest Additions installer tries
        to detect existing installation and replace them but depending
        on how the distribution integrates the Guest Additions, this may
        require some manual interaction. It is highly recommended to
        take a snapshot of the virtual machine before replacing
        pre-installed Guest Additions.

    <title>Shared Folders</title>

    <para>
      With the <emphasis>shared folders</emphasis> feature of
      VirtualBox, you can access files of your host system from within
      the guest system. This is similar how you would use network shares
      in Windows networks, except that shared folders do not need
      require networking, only the Guest Additions. Shared Folders are
      supported with Windows 2000 or later, Linux, and Solaris guests.
    </para>

    <para>
      Shared folders must physically reside on the
      <emphasis>host</emphasis> and are then shared with the guest,
      which uses a special file system driver in the Guest Addition to
      talk to the host. For Windows guests, shared folders are
      implemented as a pseudo-network redirector. For Linux and Solaris
      guests, the Guest Additions provide a virtual file system.
    </para>

    <para>
      To share a host folder with a virtual machine in VirtualBox, you
      must specify the path of that folder and choose for it a
      <emphasis>share nam</emphasis>e that the guest can use to access
      it. Hence, first create the shared folder on the host. Then,
      within the guest, you can connect to it.

      Shared folders have read/write access to the files at the host
      path by default. To restrict the guest to have read-only access,
      create a read-only shared folder. This can either be achieved
      using the GUI or by appending the parameter

    <title>Drag and Drop</title>

    <para>
      Starting with version 5.0, VirtualBox enables you to drag and drop

      work the latest Guest Additions must be installed on the guest.
    </para>

    <para>
      Drag and drop transparently allows copying or opening files,
      directories, and even certain clipboard formats from one end to
      the other. for example, from the host to the guest or from the
      guest to the host. You then can perform drag and drop operations
      between the host and a VM, as it would be a native drag and drop
      operation on the host OS.
    </para>

    <para>
      At the moment drag and drop is implemented for Windows-based and
      X-Windows-based systems, both on the host and guest side. As
      X-Windows supports many different drag and drop protocols only the
      most common one, XDND, is supported for now. Applications using
      other protocols, such as Motif or OffiX, will not be recognized by
      VirtualBox.

      In the context of using drag and drop, the origin of the data is
      called the <emphasis>source</emphasis>. That is, where the actual

      specifies where the data from the source should go to.
      Transferring data from the source to the target can be done in
      various ways, such as copying, moving, or linking.

        With this feature, if an application inside your virtual machine
        uses 3D features through the OpenGL or Direct3D 8/9 programming
        interfaces, instead of emulating them in software, which would
        be slow, VirtualBox will attempt to use your host's 3D hardware.
        This works for all supported host platforms, provided that your

              For the basic Direct3D acceleration to work in a Windows

              option that must be explicitly enabled. Also, you must

        Technically, VirtualBox implements this by installing an

        Additions are installed. This driver acts as a hardware 3D
        driver and reports to the guest operating system that the
        (virtual) hardware is capable of 3D hardware acceleration. When
        an application in the guest then requests hardware acceleration
        through the OpenGL or Direct3D programming interfaces, these are
        sent to the host through a special communication tunnel
        implemented by VirtualBox, and then the

      Starting with version 2.1, VirtualBox enables requesting of

    <para>
      To accomplish this, VirtualBox establishes a private communication
      channel between the VirtualBox Guest Additions and the host, and
      software on both sides can use this channel to exchange string
      data for arbitrary purposes. Guest properties are simply string
      keys to which a value is attached. They can be set, or written to,
      by either the host and the guest. They can also be read from both
      sides.
    </para>

      In addition to establishing the general mechanism of reading and
      writing values, a set of predefined guest properties is
      automatically maintained by the VirtualBox Guest Additions to
      allow for retrieving interesting guest data such as the guest's
      exact operating system and service pack level, the installed
      version of the Guest Additions, users that are currently logged
      into the guest OS, network statistics and more. These predefined
      properties are all prefixed with

      <title>Memory Ballooning</title>

      <para>
        Starting with version 3.2, the Guest Additions of VirtualBox can
        change the amount of host memory that a VM uses while the
        machine is running. Because of how this is implemented, this
        feature is called <emphasis>memory ballooning</emphasis>.

              VirtualBox supports memory ballooning only on 64-bit
              hosts. It is not supported on Mac OS X hosts.

              Memory ballooning does not work with large pages enabled.
              To turn off large pages support for a VM, run
              <computeroutput>VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;VM name&gt;
              --largepages off</computeroutput>

        Normally, to change the amount of memory allocated to a virtual
        machine, you have to shut down the virtual machine entirely and
        modify its settings. With memory ballooning, memory that was
        allocated for a virtual machine can be given to another virtual
        machine without having to shut the machine down.
      </para>

      <para>
        When memory ballooning is requested, the VirtualBox Guest
        Additions, which run inside the guest, allocate physical memory
        from the guest operating system on the kernel level and lock
        this memory down in the guest. This ensures that the guest will
        not use that memory any longer. No guest applications can
        allocate it, and the guest kernel will not use it either.
        VirtualBox can then reuse this memory and give it to another
        virtual machine.
      </para>

      <para>
        The memory made available through the ballooning mechanism is
        only available for reuse by VirtualBox. It is
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> returned as free memory to the host.
        Requesting balloon memory from a running guest will therefore
        not increase the amount of free, unallocated memory on the host.
        Effectively, memory ballooning is therefore a memory
        overcommitment mechanism for multiple virtual machines while
        they are running. This can be useful to temporarily start
        another machine, or in more complicated environments, for
        sophisticated memory management of many virtual machines that
        may be running in parallel depending on how memory is used by
        the guests.
      </para>

      <para>
        At this time, memory ballooning is only supported through
        VBoxManage. Use the following command to increase or decrease
        the size of the memory balloon within a running virtual machine
        that has Guest Additions installed:
      </para>

<screen>VBoxManage controlvm "VM name" guestmemoryballoon n</screen>

      <para>
        where <replaceable>VM name</replaceable> is the name or UUID of
        the virtual machine in question and <replaceable>n</replaceable>
        is the amount of memory to allocate from the guest in megabytes.
        See <xref
      linkend="vboxmanage-controlvm" />.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can also set a default balloon that will automatically be
        requested from the VM every time after it has started up with
        the following command:

<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --guestmemoryballoon n</screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        By default, no balloon memory is allocated. This is a VM
        setting, like other <computeroutput>modifyvm</computeroutput>
        settings, and therefore can only be set while the machine is
        shut down. See <xref
      linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm" />.

      <title>Page Fusion</title>

      <para>
        Whereas memory ballooning simply reduces the amount of RAM that
        is available to a VM, Page Fusion works differently. It avoids
        memory duplication between several similar running VMs.
      </para>

      <para>
        In a server environment running several similar VMs, for example
        with identical operating systems, on the same host, lots of
        memory pages are identical. VirtualBox's Page Fusion technology,
        introduced with VirtualBox 3.2, is a novel technique to
        efficiently identify these identical memory pages and share them
        between multiple VMs.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          VirtualBox supports Page Fusion only on 64-bit hosts, and it
          is not supported on Mac OS X hosts. Page Fusion currently
          works only with Windows 2000 and later guests.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        The more similar the VMs on a given host are, the more
        efficiently Page Fusion can reduce the amount of host memory
        that is in use. It therefore works best if all VMs on a host run
        identical operating systems, such as Windows XP Service Pack 2.
        Instead of having a complete copy of each operating system in
        each VM, Page Fusion identifies the identical memory pages in
        use by these operating systems and eliminates the duplicates,
        sharing host memory between several machines. This is called
        <emphasis>deduplication</emphasis>. If a VM tries to modify a
        page that has been shared with other VMs, a new page is
        allocated again for that VM with a copy of the shared page. This
        is called <emphasis>copy on write</emphasis>. All this is fully
        transparent to the virtual machine.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may be familiar with this kind of memory overcommitment from
        other hypervisor products, which call this feature
        <emphasis>page sharing</emphasis> or <emphasis>same page
        merging</emphasis>. However, Page Fusion differs significantly
        from those other solutions, whose approaches have several
        drawbacks:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Traditional hypervisors scan <emphasis>all</emphasis> guest
            memory and compute checksums (hashes) for every single
            memory page. Then, they look for pages with identical hashes
            and compare the entire content of those pages. If two pages
            produce the same hash, it is very likely that the pages are
            identical in content. This process can take rather long,
            especially if the system is not idling. As a result, the
            additional memory only becomes available after a significant
            amount of time, such as hours or sometimes days. Even worse,
            this kind of page sharing algorithm generally consumes
            significant CPU resources and increases the virtualization
            overhead by 10 to 20%.
          </para>

          <para>
            Page Fusion in VirtualBox uses logic in the VirtualBox Guest
            Additions to quickly identify memory cells that are most
            likely identical across VMs. It can therefore achieve most
            of the possible savings of page sharing almost immediately
            and with almost no overhead.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Page Fusion is also much less likely to be confused by
            identical memory that it will eliminate, just to learn
            seconds later that the memory will now change and having to
            perform a highly expensive and often service-disrupting
            reallocation.
          </para>
        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        At this time, Page Fusion can only be controlled with
        VBoxManage, and only while a VM is shut down. To enable Page
        Fusion for a VM, use the following command:
      </para>

<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --pagefusion on</screen>

      <para>
        You can observe Page Fusion operation using some metrics.
        <computeroutput>RAM/VMM/Shared</computeroutput> shows the total
        amount of fused pages, whereas the per-VM metric
        <computeroutput>Guest/RAM/Usage/Shared</computeroutput> will
        return the amount of fused memory for a given VM. See
        <xref
        linkend="vboxmanage-metrics" /> for information on
        how to query metrics.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          Enabling Page Fusion might indirectly increase the chances for
          malicious guests to successfully attack other VMs running on
          the same host. See <xref linkend="pot-insecure"/>.
