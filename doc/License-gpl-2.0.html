<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</p>
<p class="p1">freedom to share and change it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By contrast, the GNU General Public</p>
<p class="p1">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</p>
<p class="p1">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This</p>
<p class="p1">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</p>
<p class="p1">Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to</p>
<p class="p1">using it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</p>
<p class="p1">the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can apply it to</p>
<p class="p1">your programs, too.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</p>
<p class="p1">price.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</p>
<p class="p1">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</p>
<p class="p1">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</p>
<p class="p1">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</p>
<p class="p1">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</p>
<p class="p1">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</p>
<p class="p1">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</p>
<p class="p1">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</p>
<p class="p1">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</p>
<p class="p1">you have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</p>
<p class="p1">source code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you must show them these terms so they know their</p>
<p class="p1">rights.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</p>
<p class="p1">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</p>
<p class="p1">distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain</p>
<p class="p1">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</p>
<p class="p1">software.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</p>
<p class="p1">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</p>
<p class="p1">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</p>
<p class="p1">authors' reputations.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</p>
<p class="p1">patents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</p>
<p class="p1">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</p>
<p class="p1">program proprietary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</p>
<p class="p1">patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</p>
<p class="p1">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</p>
<p class="p1">under the terms of this General Public License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The "Program", below,</p>
<p class="p1">refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"</p>
<p class="p1">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</p>
<p class="p1">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</p>
<p class="p1">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</p>
<p class="p1">language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</p>
<p class="p1">the term "modification".)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</p>
<p class="p1">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The act of</p>
<p class="p1">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</p>
<p class="p1">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</p>
<p class="p1">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</p>
<p class="p1">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's</p>
<p class="p1">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</p>
<p class="p1">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</p>
<p class="p1">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</p>
<p class="p1">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</p>
<p class="p1">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</p>
<p class="p1">along with the Program.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</p>
<p class="p1">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</p>
<p class="p1">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</p>
<p class="p1">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</p>
<p class="p1">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If</p>
<p class="p1">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</p>
<p class="p1">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</p>
<p class="p1">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</p>
<p class="p1">sections when you distribute them as separate works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when you</p>
<p class="p1">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</p>
<p class="p1">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</p>
<p class="p1">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</p>
<p class="p1">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</p>
<p class="p1">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</p>
<p class="p1">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</p>
<p class="p1">collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</p>
<p class="p1">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</p>
<p class="p1">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</p>
<p class="p1">the scope of this License.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</p>
<p class="p1">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</p>
<p class="p1">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>to distribute corresponding source code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(This alternative is</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>received the program in object code or executable form with such</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</p>
<p class="p1">making modifications to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For an executable work, complete source</p>
<p class="p1">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</p>
<p class="p1">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</p>
<p class="p1">control compilation and installation of the executable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, as a</p>
<p class="p1">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</p>
<p class="p1">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</p>
<p class="p1">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</p>
<p class="p1">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</p>
<p class="p1">itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</p>
<p class="p1">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</p>
<p class="p1">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</p>
<p class="p1">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</p>
<p class="p1">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</p>
<p class="p1">except as expressly provided under this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any attempt</p>
<p class="p1">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</p>
<p class="p1">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p>
<p class="p1">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</p>
<p class="p1">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</p>
<p class="p1">parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</p>
<p class="p1">signed it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</p>
<p class="p1">distribute the Program or its derivative works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These actions are</p>
<p class="p1">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Therefore, by</p>
<p class="p1">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</p>
<p class="p1">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</p>
<p class="p1">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</p>
<p class="p1">the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</p>
<p class="p1">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</p>
<p class="p1">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</p>
<p class="p1">these terms and conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You may not impose any further</p>
<p class="p1">restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</p>
<p class="p1">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</p>
<p class="p1">this License.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</p>
<p class="p1">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</p>
<p class="p1">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p>
<p class="p1">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p>
<p class="p1">excuse you from the conditions of this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you cannot</p>
<p class="p1">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p>
<p class="p1">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</p>
<p class="p1">may not distribute the Program at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, if a patent</p>
<p class="p1">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</p>
<p class="p1">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</p>
<p class="p1">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</p>
<p class="p1">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</p>
<p class="p1">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</p>
<p class="p1">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</p>
<p class="p1">circumstances.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</p>
<p class="p1">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</p>
<p class="p1">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</p>
<p class="p1">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</p>
<p class="p1">implemented by public license practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many people have made</p>
<p class="p1">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</p>
<p class="p1">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</p>
<p class="p1">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</p>
<p class="p1">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</p>
<p class="p1">impose that choice.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</p>
<p class="p1">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</p>
<p class="p1">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</p>
<p class="p1">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</p>
<p class="p1">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</p>
<p class="p1">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</p>
<p class="p1">countries not thus excluded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In such case, this License incorporates</p>
<p class="p1">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</p>
<p class="p1">of the General Public License from time to time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such new versions will</p>
<p class="p1">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p>
<p class="p1">address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Program</p>
<p class="p1">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any</p>
<p class="p1">later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions</p>
<p class="p1">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</p>
<p class="p1">Software Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Program does not specify a version number of</p>
<p class="p1">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</p>
<p class="p1">Foundation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</p>
<p class="p1">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</p>
<p class="p1">to ask for permission.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For software which is copyrighted by the Free</p>
<p class="p1">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</p>
<p class="p1">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</p>
<p class="p1">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is safest</p>
